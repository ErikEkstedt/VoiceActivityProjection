sw2823B-ms98-a-0016 114.631625 116.255625 yeah we don't
sw2823B-ms98-a-0017 116.255625 130.460750 we don't really have a budget per se we pretty much know what our bills are and you know ours ours is pretty simple but uh but w[hat]- i do have i do have we do have a plan where we do put X number of dollars away
sw2823B-ms98-a-0018 130.460750 138.470875 every month both through the employment uh sectors and also privately in in an investment portfolio
sw2823B-ms98-a-0019 138.470875 142.899000 so that goes we take that out right off the top
sw2823B-ms98-a-0020 142.899000 154.416125 course the employment comes out before you ever see it but then the other stuff the private stuff we take out and then we disburse it into those uh accounts before we even start the rest
sw2823B-ms98-a-0021 154.416125 155.912500 uh
sw2823B-ms98-a-0022 155.912500 164.346250 but on the budget we of course we haven't really gotten into trouble by not having a budget yet i can see definitely see that there is a need for one though
sw2823B-ms98-a-0023 164.346250 174.230000 and probably as my daughter gets a little bit older and we start getting involved in in other major purchases and things like that we'll have to do that

sw2823B-ms98-a-0033 228.317125 230.073250 yeah we
sw2823B-ms98-a-0034 230.073250 234.998500 we have a we have one savings account that we have jointly
sw2823B-ms98-a-0035 234.998500 239.575500 that we can take out of if we if we decide we want something
sw2823B-ms98-a-0036 239.575500 251.944875 but that's the only one we touch everything else we have we have promised each other we will not touch anything else in fact like CDs and money markets and all kind of stuff we've got it set up to where it takes both of us to sign it
sw2823B-ms98-a-0037 251.944875 265.635500 so in case one of us decides to get weak or something like that you know say well you know if we won't miss this or we won't miss that you know uh so our our investment portion of it we don't we don't even touch it if we get low on money or we we go other avenues we don't
sw2823B-ms98-a-0038 265.635500 267.531500 we don't ever touch that so

sw2823B-ms98-a-0042 279.253500 285.648250 yeah we do the same for our daughter we have uh of course when she was born we just took you know a lump sum of money and put it in a C D
sw2823B-ms98-a-0043 285.648250 292.464375 as one one means and then we took i take a hundred dollar savings bond out of every paycheck
sw2823B-ms98-a-0044 292.464375 303.641875 that's goes directly for for her and then we also have a savings account which we do put X number of dollars in per month which is able to at least build her education fund
sw2823B-ms98-a-0045 303.641875 308.327500 [silence]
sw2823B-ms98-a-0046 308.327500 318.979625 well if you if you really look at it the kids that are are born today by the time it's college time which will be it will be cost prohibitive if if parents don't do it
sw2823B-ms98-a-0047 318.979625 323.601875 kids cannot make money that much money in in that time frame
sw2823B-ms98-a-0048 323.601875 327.227125 uh working odd jobs to pay for that kind of bill
sw2823B-ms98-a-0049 327.227125 330.696375 [silence]
sw2823B-ms98-a-0050 330.696375 331.920625 yeah
sw2823B-ms98-a-0051 331.920625 340.294375 and and there i don't think there's a lot of opportunity uh in the future for grants and loans and that kind of stuff because_1 i don't i just don't think it's going to be there
sw2823B-ms98-a-0052 340.294375 345.066625 so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there
sw2823B-ms98-a-0053 345.066625 346.796500 and uh
sw2823B-ms98-a-0054 346.796500 358.172750 who knows how much that's going to take i mean what we're taking out now may be enough it may not be and uh just don't know or there may be far more there than is ever needed but if it's if it's extra
sw2823B-ms98-a-0055 358.172750 359.575125 then she can go to
sw2823B-ms98-a-0056 359.575125 364.329000 dental school or any or anything else that she wants to do from from there so
sw2823B-ms98-a-0057 364.329000 390.278125 [silence]
sw2823B-ms98-a-0058 390.278125 391.488500 um-hum

sw2823B-ms98-a-0060 394.561625 409.125000 well you know i- i y[ou]- you brought up a real good point because_1 i because_1 i notice we do that occasionally we'll get it we'll get down and think where does all this go we just went out on a f[rivolous]- on a on a f[rivolous]- you know like a frivolous spending binge all of a sudden you know and now where did it go 
sw2823B-ms98-a-0061 409.125000 414.235500 it is uh uh because_1 i know we we have gotten ourselves into that predicament a few times
sw2823B-ms98-a-0062 414.235500 423.563000 but we've always managed you know to you know to get out of it fairly quickly we don't have a lot charged up on credit cards we don't have you know a lot of money going out
sw2823B-ms98-a-0063 423.563000 434.635500 uh than what we can pay for but i think if you do have a budget at least then maybe you'll have extra money sitting around that you can invest more in or do some other things that are a little bit more important
sw2823B-ms98-a-0064 434.635500 464.059500 [silence]
sw2823B-ms98-a-0065 464.059500 466.097750 oh isn't that something
sw2823B-ms98-a-0066 466.097750 469.090250 i say isn't that something about_1 medical bills golly
sw2823B-ms98-a-0067 469.090250 471.886625 i know just one little one little hiccup
sw2823B-ms98-a-0068 471.886625 474.312750 will just about devastate you
sw2823B-ms98-a-0069 474.312750 477.127375 [silence]

sw2823B-ms98-a-0075 491.647125 497.961375 yeah i keep pretty extensive records on on you know what i do and i average out you know utilities and things like that
sw2823B-ms98-a-0076 497.961375 502.897250 i- i project ahead i usually at the end of the month when i when i pay the bills i'll usually
sw2823B-ms98-a-0077 502.897250 510.068375 project what i'm going to need for next month but i don't really put it aside i just you know i just try to estimate what i think it's going to come to and then
sw2823B-ms98-a-0078 510.068375 513.533625 [silence]
sw2823B-ms98-a-0079 513.533625 525.875000 in some basic sense but i think a planned budget i think is is a real good idea so you just break it down in little subgroups and then you have X number of dollars what you think is adequate to pay those bills
sw2823B-ms98-a-0080 525.875000 528.286875 now do you save all your receipts
sw2823B-ms98-a-0081 528.286875 578.138125 [silence]
