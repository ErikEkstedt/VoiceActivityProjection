sw2868A-ms98-a-0041 114.253125 118.177250 and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and
sw2868A-ms98-a-0042 118.177250 126.485375 that sort of thing but we've never really uh did any diving or anything little bit of s[ailing]- of uh uh [noise] oh

sw2868A-ms98-a-0052 141.952000 147.071125 when when we were in Jersey we used to go down to the Jersey beach a lot and really enjoyed that a lot it's really they had
sw2868A-ms98-a-0053 147.071125 149.663000 there's some really nice beach areas there

sw2868A-ms98-a-0064 167.397625 176.171500 yeah we loved the we loved the the New Jersey area too because the [noise] the lakes were really pretty close you know you could
sw2868A-ms98-a-0065 176.171500 187.849750 you could drive within twenty minutes to an hour and just be at a real nice vacation spot where you could sail and and just really and then we weren't too for from the Appalachian Trail we did quite a bit of hiking
sw2868A-ms98-a-0066 187.849750 189.598875 which is kind of fun
sw2868A-ms98-a-0067 189.598875 191.004375 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0068 191.004375 192.696125 are you a you a hiker or not
sw2868A-ms98-a-0069 192.696125 194.604375 not so much huh

sw2868A-ms98-a-0073 207.570000 212.408375 so your your next your plans are try to find someplace to s[cuba]- scuba dive
sw2868A-ms98-a-0074 212.408375 216.089750 [vocalized-noise] um-hum 
sw2868A-ms98-a-0075 216.089750 217.330000 you have any children
sw2868A-ms98-a-0076 217.330000 218.366125 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0077 218.366125 220.485750 okay then that's probably one of the reasons our
sw2868A-ms98-a-0078 220.485750 228.596875 we had little children all the time so some of the things are not as quite as uh adaptable yeah it is
sw2868A-ms98-a-0079 228.596875 229.613625 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0080 229.613625 235.516625 you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy too and so i think wha[t]-
sw2868A-ms98-a-0081 235.516625 242.379375 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0082 242.379375 243.636875 yeah

sw2868A-ms98-a-0084 245.983500 251.046125 eleven or twelve i would think probably but maybe fifteen even i know that uh
sw2868A-ms98-a-0085 251.046125 264.726750 uh one of one thing that happens to us to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family you know we go wherever somebody is that we haven't seen for a while [laughter] so that that's kind of uh we just
sw2868A-ms98-a-0086 264.726750 271.114125 came back from uh uh Grand Rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate
sw2868A-ms98-a-0087 271.114125 279.884250 from uh with his Master's degree in social work and so that was fun and and the summer we have a we have a
sw2868A-ms98-a-0088 279.884250 284.743875 a reunion in in Salt Lake area up by Park Cities
sw2868A-ms98-a-0089 284.743875 286.803500 where we're going to camp for a week with
sw2868A-ms98-a-0090 286.803500 294.367375 as many members of of a rather large reunion group that uh as we can get together so
sw2868A-ms98-a-0091 294.367375 295.519125 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0092 295.519125 296.226750 yeah

sw2868A-ms98-a-0097 307.652000 310.060625 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0098 310.060625 322.732125 we we've tra[veled]- we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could
sw2868A-ms98-a-0099 322.732125 325.420125 stop and sleep maybe you know like a
sw2868A-ms98-a-0100 325.420125 336.472000 a small camper we've we've traveled in a big one i hate them [laughter] because they're hard to jockey around you know but maybe a pickup with the back on
sw2868A-ms98-a-0101 336.472000 339.326875 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0102 339.326875 342.940250 yeah so you could could kind of sleep in it 
sw2868A-ms98-a-0103 342.940250 346.860750 sometimes but you wouldn't want to do it all the time
sw2868A-ms98-a-0104 346.860750 351.331750 uh we have enough friends here and there i would just love to just drive
sw2868A-ms98-a-0105 351.331750 358.880250 through the United States and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know
sw2868A-ms98-a-0106 358.880250 362.466500 [silence]
sw2868A-ms98-a-0107 362.466500 363.462000 uh-huh

sw2868A-ms98-a-0115 381.010000 387.993625 i think that would real and i would like to maybe not take great long trips but but have your home base where your home is
sw2868A-ms98-a-0116 387.993625 391.193375 and then just travel out for like maybe oh
sw2868A-ms98-a-0117 391.193375 393.751625 a month maybe go
sw2868A-ms98-a-0118 393.751625 394.584125 and
