sw2829A-ms98-a-0044 155.443875 161.787375 yes yes well i[t]- it it is i[t]- it is accurate there's there there is um [vocalized-noise] 
sw2829A-ms98-a-0045 161.787375 167.743750 though the latter part of the sixties was totally dominated by Vietnam and uh 
sw2829A-ms98-a-0046 167.743750 176.287750 those issues and i mean you know it wa[s]- it was everywhere and and that is the one thing that i notice they sort of shy away from a little bit
sw2829A-ms98-a-0047 176.287750 186.758125 i mean [noise] they hit it a little it but they don't you know i mean it was in everything at the time i was in college and and it totally dominated college but
sw2829A-ms98-a-0048 186.758125 193.434125 uh a[t]- at at one point uh before nineteen what was it i guess it was
sw2829A-ms98-a-0049 193.434125 195.020000 seventy
sw2829A-ms98-a-0050 195.020000 200.336375 you know uh when they enacted the the what they called the lottery
sw2829A-ms98-a-0051 200.336375 204.846875 sy[stem]- of the draft in which um you know uh uh
sw2829A-ms98-a-0052 204.846875 218.890375 e[veryone's]- everyone's birthday was chosen it was chosen at random and and only the first third of those were taken a[nd]- and and would be inducted into the you know Army the Army was the only one accepting toward the end
sw2829A-ms98-a-0053 218.890375 221.243000 and so um
sw2829A-ms98-a-0054 221.243000 233.870500 you know i[t]- i[t]- it it really was terrible because uh un[til]- until that i[t]- l[east]- every one was going crazy at least when they in[ducted]- uh they they did the lottery only only one third of the people were going crazy because
sw2829A-ms98-a-0055 233.870500 238.720000 they were going to go have to go and it was a war that was really quite unpopular but
sw2829A-ms98-a-0056 238.720000 240.895875 it was kind of crazy
sw2829A-ms98-a-0057 240.895875 242.966625 [silence]
sw2829A-ms98-a-0058 242.966625 252.901000 yeah anyway s[o]- so bu[t]- but the[y]- they should uh uh y[ou]- y[ou]- y[ou]- you know i think maybe maybe hit that a little heavier on that show what other shows you watch
