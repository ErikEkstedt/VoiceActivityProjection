sw2878B-ms98-a-0012 22.953125 24.019125 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0013 24.019125 26.463000 well let me tell you what we have
sw2878B-ms98-a-0014 26.463000 33.931375 i live in a very progressive county and uh it has we have for the last
sw2878B-ms98-a-0015 33.931375 48.294125 uh year i suppose had um newspaper pickup but there's always been you know scout troops and that sort of thing interested in doing that because it they ge[t]- earn a little money and also you know they were helping the environment but the um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0016 48.294125 62.149375 the county government then got involved and decided to uh mandate newspaper collection and although they're still we still give ours to the girl scout troop at our church uh they do have curbside pickup in over the entire county for newspapers
sw2878B-ms98-a-0017 62.149375 66.709125 uh and then in addition to that they
sw2878B-ms98-a-0018 66.709125 76.462000 uh we we can put it in paper bags that's that makes it okay um they used to only re[cycle]- let you do it uh tied with string
sw2878B-ms98-a-0019 76.462000 88.882750 but now they do it in paper bags and they do say that it is paying for itself now in the actual municipality of Rockville we moved just outside of it five years ago uh they've been doing newspaper recycling even longer and they were
sw2878B-ms98-a-0020 88.882750 93.162750 they had their regular um garbage or you know
sw2878B-ms98-a-0021 93.162750 102.875875 the the social people pick it up on a separate day and they said that was paying for itself It was paying the extra salaries for those people as well as paying you know the city for doing it
sw2878B-ms98-a-0022 102.875875 115.795750 but the whole county now and it's a large county this is Montgomery County right outside Washington DC um is has begun a program to over a period of the next year to um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0023 115.795750 128.308375 have all well not all waste but um plastics um aluminum and other tin cans and uh glass of all colors
sw2878B-ms98-a-0024 128.308375 140.288250 and it's they they will you will they will also be picked up at the curb and it can be put together at one point and we've been doing it in my family for a while by at fi[rst]- at first we were doing it um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0025 140.288250 144.769250 separating it because most of the facilities that would take it were uh
sw2878B-ms98-a-0026 144.769250 156.831000 required it's being separated but they've got this wonderful new facility now that separates it and they had a drawing of it a diagram of it in in one of the local papers and it works um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0027 156.831000 164.066625 it's like conveyor belts and some of it works by gravity and of course you can imagine the aluminum because it's very light weight
sw2878B-ms98-a-0028 164.066625 173.566375 um you know falls in one place and the glass goes another place and other and tin that would be picked up by metal is just picked up you know some other way uh
sw2878B-ms98-a-0029 173.566375 185.033500 and then the plastic um you know go because it just kind of doesn't fall [laughter] i mean i guess it keeps going on the conveyor belt or something i can't remember the the design right now but it's wonderful because you don't have to separate
sw2878B-ms98-a-0030 185.033500 202.952250 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0031 202.952250 204.520250 yeah
sw2878B-ms98-a-0032 204.520250 211.518500 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0033 211.518500 215.995750 well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction
sw2878B-ms98-a-0034 215.995750 225.771500 they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that comes in with like the Sunday papers and so on
sw2878B-ms98-a-0035 225.771500 235.846500 they haven't really protested magazines shouldn't be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they haven't gotten too upset about that
sw2878B-ms98-a-0036 235.846500 240.683000 in general as long as it's the newspaper because there's not you know volume wise maybe it does have to be
sw2878B-ms98-a-0037 240.683000 247.317625 you know significant volume um percentage before it's a serious problem in the plastics
sw2878B-ms98-a-0038 247.317625 254.277875 um the the county recycling where we take ours now because we don't yet have the curbside pickup um i-
sw2878B-ms98-a-0039 254.277875 268.713500 the the trans[fer]- the you know just solid waste transfer station they uh have indicated they only want the two liter plastic soda bottles and or i guess any soda bottles that are plastic uh caps removed and uh milk cartons
sw2878B-ms98-a-0040 268.713500 278.706875 um but in fact there is another facility that will take other items the the you know there are little codes on the bottoms of these things uh for plastic and they look it's a triangle
sw2878B-ms98-a-0041 278.706875 290.635625 with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and that's probably what you're talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways
sw2878B-ms98-a-0042 290.635625 301.810000 some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that of the plastic bags but you see i'm i have a problem with that i'll take them occasionally but i've decided
sw2878B-ms98-a-0043 301.810000 312.918250 that i will only ta[ke]- use paper which we are we do get a choice because i know that's biodegradable plastic isn't they can reuse it but it's really not biodegradable
sw2878B-ms98-a-0044 312.918250 314.320625 so
sw2878B-ms98-a-0045 314.320625 321.480000 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0046 321.480000 323.554250 yeah yeah
sw2878B-ms98-a-0047 323.554250 327.271625 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0048 327.271625 328.596500 huh
sw2878B-ms98-a-0049 328.596500 332.113250 yes i am surprised yeah
sw2878B-ms98-a-0050 332.113250 339.042375 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0051 339.042375 340.921375 oh not very convenient then
sw2878B-ms98-a-0052 340.921375 344.232250 well what part of what do you actually live in Charlotte proper
sw2878B-ms98-a-0053 344.232250 347.031125 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0054 347.031125 351.305500 because my sister lives in Matthews which i think is a little south of Charlotte
sw2878B-ms98-a-0055 351.305500 352.533750 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0056 352.533750 362.918500 yeah well actually it's called Charlotte now they used to be called Matthews where she lives [laughter] they incorporated it but um i i i was thinking that you know i i i don't know what she does with hers either
sw2878B-ms98-a-0057 362.918500 369.609250 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0058 369.609250 371.107750 uh-huh
sw2878B-ms98-a-0059 371.107750 373.690000 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0060 373.690000 381.585500 well it's it's not taken on there as well although the young people i work in the school system so
sw2878B-ms98-a-0061 381.585500 393.307000 i teach in in the high school um the uh we have an environmental club which has just begun at our high school this year and i think maybe the young people are becoming more conscious of the need
sw2878B-ms98-a-0062 393.307000 402.802000 um of course it's going to get down to if it's not made easy as i just described the way they're going to do it in this county uh they're making it so easy that you almost can't miss
sw2878B-ms98-a-0063 402.802000 414.481625 uh doing it but because you don't have to separate and all that but that seems to be the only way that it'll ever really take off is if it's not too complicated because_1 people in general are just lazy and
sw2878B-ms98-a-0064 414.481625 418.287000 in the schools they are trying to make students more conscious
sw2878B-ms98-a-0065 418.287000 427.676625 and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know tha[t]-
sw2878B-ms98-a-0066 427.676625 436.667500 it doesn't go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe they'll be a little more conscious of it and eventually
sw2878B-ms98-a-0067 436.667500 443.541000 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0068 443.541000 446.116375 yes yes it does
sw2878B-ms98-a-0069 446.116375 460.025750 uh w[e]- because they they recycle the styrofoam because that's what most of the uh you know the little trays that they have their dinn[er]- you know we used to use those heavy uh plastic or whatever they were metal even trays in in the cafeterias in our schools but but now that they have these
sw2878B-ms98-a-0070 460.025750 465.635125 plastic these uh Styrofoam ones like they get at McDonald's kind of and um and those are being
sw2878B-ms98-a-0071 465.635125 466.656750 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0072 466.656750 469.785750 isn't it awful now but do you know that um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0073 469.785750 476.304125 um McDonald's is phasing them out and uh they're supposedly going to try to recycle those that are still left we're talking about
sw2878B-ms98-a-0074 476.304125 478.111125 two jillion i'm sure
sw2878B-ms98-a-0075 478.111125 484.860750 so event[ful]- it will take a time but um i i just worry about what's going to happen to the next generation um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0076 484.860750 488.446500 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0077 488.446500 489.739250 well
sw2878B-ms98-a-0078 489.739250 490.787125 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0079 490.787125 492.419500 many of them do
sw2878B-ms98-a-0080 492.419500 495.443250 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0081 495.443250 498.846375 i know oh but
sw2878B-ms98-a-0082 498.846375 504.971875 yeah exactly [laughter] that does seem a little bizarre um i i find that
sw2878B-ms98-a-0083 504.971875 512.593625 there is a percentage of of uh the student body uh that is a a aware active and interested
sw2878B-ms98-a-0084 512.593625 519.101250 there is uh a much larger percentage still that it hasn't quite you know taken yet
sw2878B-ms98-a-0085 519.101250 530.113625 um but i think they're becoming more aware i think what will make the change is um enough of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it 
sw2878B-ms98-a-0086 530.113625 534.809125 those are going to have to [laughter] ridicule peer pressure or something
sw2878B-ms98-a-0087 534.809125 538.558500 yeah to to kind of make the effort um
sw2878B-ms98-a-0088 538.558500 539.986125 but i i'm hopeful
sw2878B-ms98-a-0089 539.986125 543.555500 [silence]
sw2878B-ms98-a-0090 543.555500 547.109500 well i enjoyed talking to you and i w[ish]- i wish you luck there in Charlotte
