sw2865B-ms98-a-0003 5.007750 6.514250 right
sw2865B-ms98-a-0004 6.514250 14.550625 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0005 14.550625 16.030625 right
sw2865B-ms98-a-0006 16.030625 27.536375 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0007 27.536375 42.054500 well that's i would say that's probably true uh i know in in my wife's case she is a very independent sort uh you know she she has a lot of say about uh you know just about everything that uh happens in our family life
sw2865B-ms98-a-0008 42.054500 43.133250 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0009 43.133250 52.714625 and yes i am i i you know i i feel very confident that if you know something were to happen to me or to us either one that uh you know she would be
sw2865B-ms98-a-0010 52.714625 61.102375 capable of taking care of her own you know what ever her own needs are right and and i think that's very important
sw2865B-ms98-a-0011 61.102375 62.983875 [noise]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0012 62.983875 71.969750 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0013 71.969750 86.178000 well i i really think that that that independence of of women is uh probably more important an and i guess that uh really came about because of the change or a lot of it anyway because of the change in the work force
sw2865B-ms98-a-0014 86.178000 94.765125 uh with more women working and having uh more uh important or or uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0015 94.765125 101.848500 what's the right term anyway their jobs is being you know more people depending on them and more management decisions made
sw2865B-ms98-a-0016 101.848500 105.840000 i think that uh lends to being you know more independent and
sw2865B-ms98-a-0017 105.840000 110.303125 stepping out and saying what you want to say and what needs to be said 
sw2865B-ms98-a-0018 110.303125 119.076750 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0019 119.076750 129.609000 yes i i i that's even even uh upper management is is uh i think is going to be a a coming thing for for women too uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0020 129.609000 138.008250 and in the professions also not just uh not just within company management but you know professional people that uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0021 138.008250 144.648750 are going out on their own attorneys and lawyers i'm an accountant a CPA
sw2865B-ms98-a-0022 144.648750 155.673125 and uh i know quite a few women CPA's you know that are out working on their own running their own accounting practice and doing quite well
sw2865B-ms98-a-0023 155.673125 167.877250 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0024 167.877250 176.070750 uh i would i'm not sure but i would think so within uh within a public accounting firm
sw2865B-ms98-a-0025 176.070750 183.817875 uh if they're on the same level of responsibility now i would say that there's you know some
sw2865B-ms98-a-0026 183.817875 186.965125 uh or i would even say a probability
sw2865B-ms98-a-0027 186.965125 201.119750 that women still have it a little more difficult to achieve the same level that a man does uh there's you know there's still some stereotypes uh within even within the the accounting practice
sw2865B-ms98-a-0028 201.119750 202.613000 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0029 202.613000 204.164250 yeah right
sw2865B-ms98-a-0030 204.164250 206.474375 [noise]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0031 206.474375 212.010625 um but um within pu[blic]- within public accounting
sw2865B-ms98-a-0032 212.010625 221.685250 within the what is now the big six accounting firms in particular the uh the people that's starting off in accounting uh have an awful lot
sw2865B-ms98-a-0033 221.685250 228.686500 of uh hours to work and and there's a lot of stress put on them uh a lot of requirements for
sw2865B-ms98-a-0034 228.686500 235.187250 uh you know traveling and being available all uh hours and and that kind of thing
sw2865B-ms98-a-0035 235.187250 247.815375 right and and i think that uh that some women may you know they may tend still tend to to not want to do that [vocalized-noise] to the point that they would restrict their own possibility for
sw2865B-ms98-a-0036 247.815375 257.002000 uh for promotion to achieve that but you know the ones that the ones that really want to uh certainly can go ahead and achieve that
sw2865B-ms98-a-0037 257.002000 259.935500 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0038 259.935500 265.441250 um i i would say that uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0039 265.441250 272.996750 there will be you know in the business world there will be more uh opportunities more expansion of the women's role in business
sw2865B-ms98-a-0040 272.996750 286.006125 and i see uh women's roles expanding in the political area uh quite a bit uh of course you know we in Texas we've got uh uh a uh woman governor now
sw2865B-ms98-a-0041 286.006125 300.081625 uh and we've had the all let's see what have we got uh four say five major cities in Texas that have all had women mayors i think uh recently uh three
sw2865B-ms98-a-0042 300.081625 303.458125 at least three of them have women mayors now
sw2865B-ms98-a-0043 303.458125 304.814125 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0044 304.814125 308.460250 and uh you know i- s[ee]- i see uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0045 308.460250 314.153500 you know the movement of women into into the political arena as being very important uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0046 314.153500 337.817000 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0047 337.817000 340.209875 yeah the supermom yes

sw2865B-ms98-a-0055 366.988625 374.361250 right i i think they'll be uh [vocalized-noise] you know in in the political area i suppose uh
sw2865B-ms98-a-0056 374.361250 385.544875 fo[r]- for the most part politicians have gone through their a a good bit of their business life before they get into politics
sw2865B-ms98-a-0057 385.544875 399.235625 and and i think that that if that's the the situation for women they will have had their family life and their business life you know may be earlier and then move into politics
sw2865B-ms98-a-0058 399.235625 411.511500 and i think that's uh you know that's the way that uh that you can ha[ve]- you know women can have all things you you just can't have them all at once [noise] and uh i think that's you know that's the case for men [vocalized-noise] you know for the most part too
sw2865B-ms98-a-0059 411.511500 422.574625 [silence]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0060 422.574625 424.291500 uh-hum

sw2865B-ms98-a-0062 426.136000 440.407750 well i i think that's uh that's the truth a[nd]- and i i think that there's i think and this is uh may be a bad thing for me to say but i think that women have a higher moral uh character for the most part
sw2865B-ms98-a-0063 440.407750 446.676250 than men do and it you know the [vocalized-noise] along the sexual type you know the [vocalized-noise]
sw2865B-ms98-a-0064 446.676250 450.741375 th[e]- th[e]- the little things that men that get involved in
sw2865B-ms98-a-0065 450.741375 458.501875 right that uh women just don't tend to do that of of course it takes you know it takes a man and a women both but i think that women have
sw2865B-ms98-a-0066 458.501875 467.716750 or or a little more uh discreet or at at least a little more careful about what they do and are and you know
sw2865B-ms98-a-0067 467.716750 479.752625 wo[man]- a woman congressman's not going to have her picture taken on a boat somewhere out in the Caribbean with you know with some young guy you know for the most part yeah
