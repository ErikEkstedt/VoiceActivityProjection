sw2853A-ms98-a-0037 160.904250 162.477375 um-hum
sw2853A-ms98-a-0038 162.477375 171.551625 that's interesting um here you know Kodak is the the big name in Rochester Kodak
sw2853A-ms98-a-0039 171.551625 177.187625 what is Kodak Ko[dak]- yeah the film right no it's okay but um
sw2853A-ms98-a-0040 177.187625 191.601625 i mean in Rochester everything is Kodak but you know but half the population here works for Kodak and um usually they set the trends and originally um it was only the people that were working in the industrial
sw2853A-ms98-a-0041 191.601625 204.946625 type of f[acilities]- facilities that needed to be drug tested because they felt that if they were using drugs they would be the most dangerous versus office type workers who probably
sw2853A-ms98-a-0042 204.946625 208.367000 i don't know you know what they they never saw what sort of um
sw2853A-ms98-a-0043 208.367000 217.352375 you know problem they could have if they were using drugs i guess i don't know but um just in nineteen i guess it was nineteen eighty nine they started testing everybody
sw2853A-ms98-a-0044 217.352375 223.433000 so now anybody whether you want to go in and work in the cafeteria or be
sw2853A-ms98-a-0045 223.433000 232.269250 yes they can but they can't do it more than once a year i think you you can't be tested more than once a year
sw2853A-ms98-a-0046 232.269250 235.108500 would they spot test at TI

sw2853A-ms98-a-0052 245.863500 255.461125 well um the thing you know you brought up about Mayor Berry [vocalized-noise] you've probably seen the clip on the news the one where he's um 
sw2853A-ms98-a-0053 255.461125 262.516375 going into that room and and making the deal with somebody did you see that well the you know he got
sw2853A-ms98-a-0054 262.516375 271.519875 he got acquitted or whatever the term is but th[e]- yeah that he was um the charges were removed that to me is so
sw2853A-ms98-a-0055 271.519875 280.841500 oh i know and it's so absurd because now kids are going to see that and say oh look he got off the hook i'll get off the hook too you know

sw2853A-ms98-a-0068 323.643250 333.851750 but um i think that your point about schools is um probably the first place to start because they're the ones that are influencing
sw2853A-ms98-a-0069 333.851750 339.328000 the new generation you know that are going to become the people working in those companies
