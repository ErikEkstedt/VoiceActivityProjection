sw2828A-ms98-a-0002 1.082375 4.076000 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0003 4.076000 7.206875 i certainly do i think
sw2828A-ms98-a-0004 7.206875 16.049375 i think we have a lousy school system and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well
sw2828A-ms98-a-0005 16.049375 22.288750 and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents
sw2828A-ms98-a-0006 22.288750 33.143500 and then oh we don't uh we put too much uh responsibility on the teachers for things that are really not education they're social services
sw2828A-ms98-a-0007 33.143500 36.494875 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0008 36.494875 44.748875 [laughter-well] i as a matter of fact i just finished editing a book on the topic so i have some rather strong opinions 
sw2828A-ms98-a-0009 44.748875 48.823375 and and i'm sure they're colored by what i've edited
sw2828A-ms98-a-0010 48.823375 52.169500 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0011 52.169500 56.580125 yes i do and i was not very happy with the results
sw2828A-ms98-a-0012 56.580125 61.228250 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0013 61.228250 69.047875 well i think i would start with uh about_1 with getting rid of about two thirds of the administrators
sw2828A-ms98-a-0014 69.047875 76.465000 and all the auxiliary personnel the school bureaucracy that exists mainly to perpetuate itself
sw2828A-ms98-a-0015 76.465000 89.059750 and then i would provide uh use the money that we've been paying them to uh provide some special help in training and particularly uh mentor teachers
sw2828A-ms98-a-0016 89.059750 98.547750 to work with the beginning teachers and the teachers who [laughter-may] [laughter-have] [laughter-been] [laughter-at] [laughter-it] [laughter-a] [laughter-long] [laughter-time] [laughter-but] [laughter-have] [laughter-been] [laughter-making] [laughter-the] [laughter-same] [laughter-mistakes] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-long] [laughter-time]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0017 98.547750 112.057875 and then let them_1 try some innovative things and see what works and then uh have some sort of mechanism for passing that knowledge along to other teachers who could benefit from the same sorts of things
sw2828A-ms98-a-0018 112.057875 123.235625 and then from the parents side have the parents support the school get involved pay attention to what's happening talk to the teachers uh talk to their kids about school
sw2828A-ms98-a-0019 123.235625 132.558625 and support the institution and a instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that the uh the teacher's in the middle
sw2828A-ms98-a-0020 132.558625 136.867250 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0021 136.867250 146.186875 [laughter-well] i've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people
sw2828A-ms98-a-0022 146.186875 148.183750 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0023 148.183750 154.466375 oh well that i'm not so sure about i've got a lot of things to keep me busy
sw2828A-ms98-a-0024 154.466375 157.602875 have you done anything like that anything political
sw2828A-ms98-a-0025 157.602875 158.874375 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0026 158.874375 160.344750 um-hum
sw2828A-ms98-a-0027 160.344750 174.744375 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0028 174.744375 176.010375 um-hum
sw2828A-ms98-a-0029 176.010375 180.617500 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0030 180.617500 183.160250 that's more than a lot [laughter]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0031 183.160250 198.810625 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0032 198.810625 200.525750 um-hum
sw2828A-ms98-a-0033 200.525750 220.726250 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0034 220.726250 222.089125 yeah
sw2828A-ms98-a-0035 222.089125 225.719750 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0036 225.719750 235.616250 i think that's absolutely right they the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board you're going to be
sw2828A-ms98-a-0037 235.616250 245.321875 uh rewarding people who've been doing a lousy job and instead of getting the uh improvement that we want so we'd have to have some way to
sw2828A-ms98-a-0038 245.321875 256.254625 uh reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them uh a pat on the back and respect and some honor and more money
sw2828A-ms98-a-0039 256.254625 262.248750 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0040 262.248750 265.590125 um-hum yeah it's hard to tell
sw2828A-ms98-a-0041 265.590125 277.064875 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0042 277.064875 278.582625 yeah
sw2828A-ms98-a-0043 278.582625 297.260000 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0044 297.260000 300.343125 yeah now that's a very good suggestion
sw2828A-ms98-a-0045 300.343125 306.588625 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0046 306.588625 308.235000 yeah i don't think
sw2828A-ms98-a-0047 308.235000 316.816000 student i don't think student teaching is enough i think that at least what i used to observe in student teaching was that
sw2828A-ms98-a-0048 316.816000 330.780750 some college kid who might not be all that bright to begin with was thrown into a classroom with a teacher who was harried and overworked and uh had too many kids to handle and too many things to do and too many interruptions
sw2828A-ms98-a-0049 330.780750 337.133750 to pay much attention to the student teacher and then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks
sw2828A-ms98-a-0050 337.133750 347.627500 so there really was no time to try much of anything and get significant feedback that would help the the student teacher improve very much
sw2828A-ms98-a-0051 347.627500 355.624500 there are lots of things that could be done in that line including things like videotaping because it wouldn't be hard
sw2828A-ms98-a-0052 355.624500 364.500875 with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to videotape uh either a master teacher teaching a class
sw2828A-ms98-a-0053 364.500875 374.596500 so that then students could watch that and uh criticize the methods used and and analyze it figure out what worked and what didn't work
sw2828A-ms98-a-0054 374.596500 379.700375 and then also to videotape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance
sw2828A-ms98-a-0055 379.700375 391.872500 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0056 391.872500 393.532125 um
sw2828A-ms98-a-0057 393.532125 395.011125 [laughter]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0058 395.011125 396.066750 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0059 396.066750 398.337750 i don't think that's going to work
sw2828A-ms98-a-0060 398.337750 408.422750 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0061 408.422750 415.857375 yeah well another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of uh
sw2828A-ms98-a-0062 415.857375 425.222875 say a national curriculum because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for uh
sw2828A-ms98-a-0063 425.222875 436.772250 curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in Texas and California and then everybody else is stuck with that regardless of what they want to teach
sw2828A-ms98-a-0064 436.772250 438.539000 because it
sw2828A-ms98-a-0065 438.539000 443.444000 well that's the two states that adopt on a statewide basis
sw2828A-ms98-a-0066 443.444000 454.269750 uh and so it uh i used to work for a textbook publisher and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by Texas
sw2828A-ms98-a-0067 454.269750 467.836500 then you had a built-in market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted in the individual school districts
sw2828A-ms98-a-0068 467.836500 474.964125 and you know a third of the Texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks
sw2828A-ms98-a-0069 474.964125 485.609375 and then the states that either don't adopt on a statewide basis or don't have as many kids just have to follow along and take what Texas gets
sw2828A-ms98-a-0070 485.609375 493.869750 like with California is the biggest for elementary schools but Texas uh adopts statewide all the way through the twelfth grade
sw2828A-ms98-a-0071 493.869750 497.270625 [silence]
sw2828A-ms98-a-0072 497.270625 499.645750 yep sure is
sw2828A-ms98-a-0073 499.645750 507.139250 and i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with uh Reagan's
sw2828A-ms98-a-0074 507.139250 516.217625 uh new education secretary and uh you know trying to do some uh trying to produce some new programs anyway
sw2828A-ms98-a-0075 516.217625 518.046750 excuse me
sw2828A-ms98-a-0076 518.046750 522.040875 i have got to go i've got another line calling thanks bye
sw2828A-ms98-a-0077 522.040875 524.196500 [noise]
