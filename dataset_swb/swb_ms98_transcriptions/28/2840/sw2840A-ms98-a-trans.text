sw2840A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.080000 [noise]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0002 1.080000 4.867500 do you have any particular thoughts about the school system
sw2840A-ms98-a-0003 4.867500 30.064625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0004 30.064625 35.008250 [laughter] i say agree with you a hundred [laughter-percent] [laughter-there] 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0005 35.008250 38.290625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0006 38.290625 39.451875 oh
sw2840A-ms98-a-0007 39.451875 50.660625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0008 50.660625 51.855250 yeah
sw2840A-ms98-a-0009 51.855250 57.660750 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0010 57.660750 66.639250 yeah it's interesting because uh we're just having conversation on this uh with a couple of people yesterday and i was expressing my frustrations that uh
sw2840A-ms98-a-0011 66.639250 75.828375 some of the so many problems i [vocalized-noise] i work in a high school are that kids don't have a a degree uh a of self-discipline which may be reflected
sw2840A-ms98-a-0012 75.828375 87.641000 in society at large uh and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract uh sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home
sw2840A-ms98-a-0013 87.641000 94.999375 um and it's seen more so because when you call parents up many parents won't even recognize
sw2840A-ms98-a-0014 94.999375 103.847250 that there is a problem [vocalized-noise] [laughter-and] will say they'll say oh well our kids uh my kid i've never heard anything about this before this is the first time there have been problems and 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0015 103.847250 114.838375 and you [vocalized-noise] don't these parents know that teachers talk and you know we do check with other teachers and other teachers find the same things for this child and you know how do you tell your parent's the parent hey wake up and smell the coffee [laughter] 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0016 114.838375 126.867375 but um it it is a problem and i'm not sure just uh how how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it whether maybe through a commitment of the PTA
sw2840A-ms98-a-0017 126.867375 136.252375 uh and the parents being informed better that in fact that the problems that are nationwide
sw2840A-ms98-a-0018 136.252375 141.619375 a[re]- are problems um of society and that that the school can only do so much on it
sw2840A-ms98-a-0019 141.619375 149.653625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0020 149.653625 151.144250 um-hum
sw2840A-ms98-a-0021 151.144250 155.353375 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0022 155.353375 156.950875 yeah yeah
sw2840A-ms98-a-0023 156.950875 163.140000 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0024 163.140000 166.205750 that's right um-hum
sw2840A-ms98-a-0025 166.205750 167.665000 [noise]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0026 167.665000 169.925250 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0027 169.925250 177.697750 you know what scares me too is that we have yet to see uh the biggest effect of the crack children
sw2840A-ms98-a-0028 177.697750 190.169875 uh in the school system these are children that are born with low deficit attention deficit and gosh what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system that that's really scary
sw2840A-ms98-a-0029 190.169875 200.561875 but there are i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve and this is something that i see too many times students get
sw2840A-ms98-a-0030 200.561875 207.407875 diagnosed as [vocalized-noise] slow learners and in fact they're not they're behavior problems
sw2840A-ms98-a-0031 207.407875 218.324375 and so they get put in in in our school system in a class that's limited for skills children that have really have to master skills and that's not their problem
sw2840A-ms98-a-0032 218.324375 222.614000 um at the same time i've seen we we have a
sw2840A-ms98-a-0033 222.614000 236.252500 uh an international population there's no bridge area for students coming out of the ESOL which is English for Speakers of Other Languages program the once they're past ESOL they get out they got thrown right into the total mainstream
sw2840A-ms98-a-0034 236.252500 242.737000 and uh there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition
sw2840A-ms98-a-0035 242.737000 256.203375 for that so the school systems can improve both in standing up for splitting classes you know [vocalized-noise] having learning dis[abled]- learning slow slow children in slow classes but not mixing them with behavior problems 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0036 256.203375 264.412250 and then you know the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated
sw2840A-ms98-a-0037 264.412250 272.202250 and then you throw in kids that are not motivated maybe bright but they're discipline problems and you sometimes the average classes really
sw2840A-ms98-a-0038 272.202250 275.978750 are problems because you've got such a mixed bag there
sw2840A-ms98-a-0039 275.978750 282.395250 you know the gifted and talented are fast classes there's really not that much of a problem with but it's
sw2840A-ms98-a-0040 282.395250 288.047375 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0041 288.047375 289.055250 um-hum

sw2840A-ms98-a-0043 297.138625 298.471000 that's yeah
sw2840A-ms98-a-0044 298.471000 306.500750 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0045 306.500750 313.696375 i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration
sw2840A-ms98-a-0046 313.696375 320.863500 [laughter]

sw2840A-ms98-a-0053 339.969125 346.684625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0054 346.684625 357.232625 yeah i guess kids do mature at different ages too that's and you know as a teacher you you try to make be understanding that you know there are different ages kids are is [vocalized-noise]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0055 357.232625 363.916375 that a kid that's just a question of maturity or is he a problem child but teachers are asked to diagnose so much 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0056 363.916375 370.845000 um there i mean i mean we're have to be we're alerted there's all sorts of systems where suicide
sw2840A-ms98-a-0057 370.845000 379.086625 uh predisposition i mean we're alerted to what the moment we see something if we see a child that we have any reason that's on drugs such as if he's got a beeper or
sw2840A-ms98-a-0058 379.086625 388.311500 they're if they're flashing lots of money around we've there are certain things to do i mean so tea[chers]- the school system's asked to do so much but you can't operate in a vacuum 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0059 388.311500 390.208625 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0060 390.208625 394.414500 this is a we're in a rather wealthy suburb of Washington
sw2840A-ms98-a-0061 394.414500 399.572000 and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the uh principal
sw2840A-ms98-a-0062 399.572000 402.158750 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0063 402.158750 405.688500 it's for drug use they can't imagine for anything else
sw2840A-ms98-a-0064 405.688500 415.362000 you you know it's it's amazing but uh uh you get all sorts you get all all sorts of things uh in the schools uh uh and it's 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0065 415.362000 425.336125 and you know as a teacher you're alert you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a um behavioral change and you refer them to the nurse and
sw2840A-ms98-a-0066 425.336125 432.558625 and so i mean you have to find out whether there's a legitimate [laughter-reason] or whether this is a warning signal 
sw2840A-ms98-a-0067 432.558625 434.157500 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0068 434.157500 440.077000 and parents frequently resent when you ask them is there a problem that we should be aware of
sw2840A-ms98-a-0069 440.077000 444.598500 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0070 444.598500 445.995875 um-hum
sw2840A-ms98-a-0071 445.995875 456.282375 [silence]

sw2840A-ms98-a-0075 469.467875 472.939250 [silence]
sw2840A-ms98-a-0076 472.939250 481.449000 yeah the denial mechanism is really strong and so many parents are facilitators i mean they're manipulated by their children i've been fortunate i have uh
sw2840A-ms98-a-0077 481.449000 492.789250 a son who's a sophomore in college up in Massachusetts at uh Amherst and my other son is a senior in high school and he's going on to Williams and i mean they're really super they're both national level swimmers
sw2840A-ms98-a-0078 492.789250 505.364250 and where we've been very fortunate but you know they had to be held accountable too i mean you know at some point a parent does help their kid but in in some ways but but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative
sw2840A-ms98-a-0079 505.364250 512.350250 and i think this is where the school system uh is suffering and not through any fault of the effort of the school system
sw2840A-ms98-a-0080 512.350250 515.590750 but gee it was good talking with you
sw2840A-ms98-a-0081 515.590750 521.762875 yeah so there are people throughout the country that feel [laughter] that you do and and are connected with the schools
