sw2858A-ms98-a-0009 41.057750 48.196375 it's it's really hard hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and

sw2858A-ms98-a-0020 105.934500 114.438875 yeah i i think i think that would be the ideal situation i think that a lot of people like in my case i i do shift work
sw2858A-ms98-a-0021 114.438875 117.159500 i don't i don't have that choice
sw2858A-ms98-a-0022 117.159500 126.650625 um i have to be at work at at X hour you know at this at at a certain hour and i can't it's not flexible
sw2858A-ms98-a-0023 126.650625 139.950000 um it it would be nice uh to be able to have flexible hours and and maybe after we decide to have kids i i might find a job that has flexible hours i woul[d]- i hope so anyway um but i would i don't know 
sw2858A-ms98-a-0024 139.950000 141.344125 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0025 141.344125 143.126375 uh-huh
sw2858A-ms98-a-0026 143.126375 151.744875 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0027 151.744875 153.034375 uh-huh
sw2858A-ms98-a-0028 153.034375 161.860000 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0029 161.860000 163.811000 yeah
sw2858A-ms98-a-0030 163.811000 171.120375 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0031 171.120375 172.947750 yeah
sw2858A-ms98-a-0032 172.947750 175.790250 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0033 175.790250 184.752500 yeah i ideally it w[ould]- it would be nice to be able to just have like [vocalized-noise] back in the old days you know back like whe[n]- when i grew up 
sw2858A-ms98-a-0034 184.752500 192.659500 you know the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school
sw2858A-ms98-a-0035 192.659500 198.239500 um so she was there pretty much all my you know formative years
sw2858A-ms98-a-0036 198.239500 202.573250 and that was nice and i liked that and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids
sw2858A-ms98-a-0037 202.573250 210.575000 but i think with the way the future is um economy wise i don't think it's going to be realistic
sw2858A-ms98-a-0038 210.575000 224.018625 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0039 224.018625 236.743625 i yeah i i think that i think very few spend quality time i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff stuff like that i think that um
sw2858A-ms98-a-0040 236.743625 237.775625 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0041 237.775625 245.311000 um uh most most kids that i see don't really they don't really value quality time
sw2858A-ms98-a-0042 245.311000 248.119250 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0043 248.119250 251.343625 uh until until they're older and then they look back 
sw2858A-ms98-a-0044 251.343625 270.760000 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0045 270.760000 273.366625 oh really
sw2858A-ms98-a-0046 273.366625 281.671125 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0047 281.671125 283.169375 yeah
sw2858A-ms98-a-0048 283.169375 288.599375 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0049 288.599375 294.984750 i i think kids now a days are raised on TV i mean that's that's almost like a surro[gate]- TV is a surrogate parent
sw2858A-ms98-a-0050 294.984750 296.188625 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0051 296.188625 298.765250 and not a and not a very good one at that
sw2858A-ms98-a-0052 298.765250 309.853375 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0053 309.853375 312.816750 um i i hope to
sw2858A-ms98-a-0054 312.816750 323.247375 of course be able to teach them right from wrong i hope i hope to be able to spend um their growing up years being in the home you know not having to work
sw2858A-ms98-a-0055 323.247375 329.278875 um and being able to do i i i know a lot of people wh[o]- who um
sw2858A-ms98-a-0056 329.278875 337.348250 um i work part-time also and i a lot of people that i work for are mothers that stay home
sw2858A-ms98-a-0057 337.348250 345.850750 um and they they do a lot of volunteer work and they're real active in the community and um they do a lot of things with their kids
sw2858A-ms98-a-0058 345.850750 349.723375 that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working
sw2858A-ms98-a-0059 349.723375 355.140875 and i'd i'd like to be able to do that i'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids
sw2858A-ms98-a-0060 355.140875 356.429500 [silence]

sw2858A-ms98-a-0062 357.971500 362.384875 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0063 362.384875 367.900250 yeah but i think that's for the the few and far between i think that uh
sw2858A-ms98-a-0064 367.900250 375.729875 probably ninety percent of the of the um parents out there are are probably working parents
sw2858A-ms98-a-0065 375.729875 378.383125 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0066 378.383125 387.386000 and i and i don't i don't really see that that trend changing much if anything i think there's going to be fewer and fewer uh single income families 
sw2858A-ms98-a-0067 387.386000 393.513500 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0068 393.513500 394.760375 yeah

sw2858A-ms98-a-0073 414.761000 425.664625 yeah i i see it seems like that's that's a big trend you know in the last ten years day cares have have have popped up and become a lot more um
sw2858A-ms98-a-0074 425.664625 429.806000 a lot bigger part of of the kids lives
sw2858A-ms98-a-0075 429.806000 432.389375 it's like a home away from home for a lot of them
sw2858A-ms98-a-0076 432.389375 443.824500 [silence]
sw2858A-ms98-a-0077 443.824500 448.511750 yeah but i think it's [vocalized-noise] yeah i think this is a good closing point
