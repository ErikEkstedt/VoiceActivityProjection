sw2834B-ms98-a-0005 14.857750 15.990000 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0006 15.990000 18.174625 yeah i'm just a
sw2834B-ms98-a-0007 18.174625 22.063125 spring chicken i guess [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0008 22.063125 25.318000 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0009 25.318000 26.675625 well
sw2834B-ms98-a-0010 26.675625 27.788750 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0011 27.788750 29.055125 right oh 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0012 29.055125 29.347500 [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0013 29.347500 30.683375 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0014 30.683375 32.557250 i think i'm ready [noise]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0015 32.557250 37.963750 [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0016 37.963750 48.228750 well let's see the changes i've seen in women's roles uh since i am in the forty age i'm a fifties baby um
sw2834B-ms98-a-0017 48.228750 57.793000 and from my mother's generation to my generation it's just a very very wide um it's been a big change
sw2834B-ms98-a-0018 57.793000 70.165125 very much and i think you'll have to agree and since we were in uh sort of the ground level the bra burning of the sixties and and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be
sw2834B-ms98-a-0019 70.165125 79.833375 um and i think you know it got off to a really radical it has a radical fringe to it that um i've sort of backed away from
sw2834B-ms98-a-0020 79.833375 82.238875 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0021 82.238875 83.791000 yeah
sw2834B-ms98-a-0022 83.791000 84.982625 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0023 84.982625 89.371500 and to make a change you know you have to make a splash but
sw2834B-ms98-a-0024 89.371500 102.177000 to continue in that vein i think it got a little bit warped and off the track [vocalized-noise] in several areas but i really do think that women have made a contribution 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0025 102.177000 111.678000 um to human beings i mean to be human and what it's like and have feelings and emotions and it's okay and i think
sw2834B-ms98-a-0026 111.678000 125.975500 um you know on the other hand i don't know that men have changed that much so in in contrast to the women's changes um you know the men stay steady and then the women change around them
sw2834B-ms98-a-0027 125.975500 127.984250 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0028 127.984250 130.965625 um i think men are trying
sw2834B-ms98-a-0029 130.965625 141.935750 but they don't have a national organization of men to uh help them_1 out and um what's changing them though is the economic situation where both
sw2834B-ms98-a-0030 141.935750 146.372000 team it has to be a team partnership now and they both have to work
sw2834B-ms98-a-0031 146.372000 156.112125 and they both have to raise the children if we're going to have any kind of future at all and and that i think has been the downfall of the last ten years you know the me
sw2834B-ms98-a-0032 156.112125 160.157875 oh i don't know the the {yuppiedom} the whatever it was the
sw2834B-ms98-a-0033 160.157875 172.736500 you know women didn't know how to go about doing the careers and they wanted to compete with men they wanted to be like men and that's wrong i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men men [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0034 172.736500 174.012750 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0035 174.012750 178.768375 absolutely and so that's you know they sort of threw the thing back another
sw2834B-ms98-a-0036 178.768375 192.063000 you know ten years that they've had to you know restructure but i saw the greatest T-shirt the other day i got to get some for all my men friends it says let men run the world women have more important things to [laughter-do] 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0037 192.063000 192.624750 [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0038 192.624750 194.270250 [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0039 194.270250 201.771375 right but um i think men and women both have valuable valuable assets to offer
sw2834B-ms98-a-0040 201.771375 209.347000 and you know we shouldn't we were made differently however you come to that conclusion we were
sw2834B-ms98-a-0041 209.347000 220.384625 biologically physiologically made differently and there is great wonderment in that and uh you know we should respect that in each other so
sw2834B-ms98-a-0042 220.384625 227.682250 right and and you know just sort of all s[wooshed]- swooshed into one channel sort of thing it's
sw2834B-ms98-a-0043 227.682250 239.990625 it's viva la [laughter-difference] [laughter-someone] [laughter-said] [laughter-that] and and i think that you can truly respect the other person i mean you know Tom is just always saying what a mystery you are [laughter-you] [laughter-know] depends on
sw2834B-ms98-a-0044 239.990625 243.761000 yeah well see that depends on what day of the month it is [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0045 243.761000 257.919000 but um i don't know i guess we've gotten more of a [vocalized-noise] in in terms of that i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other and our roles and but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0046 257.919000 265.348125 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0047 265.348125 274.933875 yeah well that's that's a very different way to do th[ings]- you know the woman doesn't start off at home raising the kids and goes back into her career you know twenty years later
sw2834B-ms98-a-0048 274.933875 276.897375 um
sw2834B-ms98-a-0049 276.897375 278.508250 you do
sw2834B-ms98-a-0050 278.508250 280.119000 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0051 280.119000 281.389000 yeah
sw2834B-ms98-a-0052 281.389000 284.488500 [silence]

sw2834B-ms98-a-0057 290.490375 292.071875 [silence]

sw2834B-ms98-a-0059 294.201000 295.896375 how did you do
sw2834B-ms98-a-0060 295.896375 297.764250 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0061 297.764250 301.121125 well i mean okay well did you have boys girls how did
sw2834B-ms98-a-0062 301.121125 303.615375 h[ow]-
sw2834B-ms98-a-0063 303.615375 305.346750 oh my
sw2834B-ms98-a-0064 305.346750 307.179500 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0065 307.179500 309.584625 oh my
sw2834B-ms98-a-0066 309.584625 313.374500 oh how exciting
sw2834B-ms98-a-0067 313.374500 323.871500 i- i tell you what i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids i just love the babies and and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that it's
sw2834B-ms98-a-0068 323.871500 325.197000 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0069 325.197000 329.547625 just eight years just the most important years of my life [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0070 329.547625 338.954625 yeah it has been and um so there have been major major adjustments but that's another story but you know my husband has really really
sw2834B-ms98-a-0071 338.954625 342.022250 filled in the gaps i mean i
sw2834B-ms98-a-0072 342.022250 352.911500 i couldn't ask for a better life i mean if this is the way it had to be this is the best way i could possibly do it and and that has a lot to do with his strength and his
sw2834B-ms98-a-0073 352.911500 362.561125 just pitching in and and his being able to you know all all ego aside do a lot of things that really
sw2834B-ms98-a-0074 362.561125 368.337250 so when i say men haven't changed i guess i should look at my own [laughter-backyard] sort of thing and
sw2834B-ms98-a-0075 368.337250 372.035750 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0076 372.035750 373.599500 oh yeah
sw2834B-ms98-a-0077 373.599500 376.264500 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0078 376.264500 384.827750 yeah that's true i mean boy i mean i- i would have had so i had so much guilt to begin with and the changes that had to take place
sw2834B-ms98-a-0079 384.827750 394.589750 you know where i couldn't do a lot of things and um just adjusting to that that um yeah that was a major change but so i guess 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0080 394.589750 401.273375 um [noise] in the end you know you each take your own situation and you and you deal with it the best you can but 
sw2834B-ms98-a-0081 401.273375 410.001000 but but women i think are a whole you know sort of riding the course they're they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there i think
sw2834B-ms98-a-0082 410.001000 416.040625 the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation
sw2834B-ms98-a-0083 416.040625 421.934375 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0084 421.934375 434.307125 i think we're going to see a generation of kids that you know are just going to be a little bit um [noise] oh not very nurturing i think
sw2834B-ms98-a-0085 434.307125 439.160750 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0086 439.160750 447.514750 yeah but i wish they weren't so many i- i wish they weren't role models for everybody because it's so dangerous
sw2834B-ms98-a-0087 447.514750 453.675750 it's dangerous for the woman too to think that she can do that and then when she can't you know the failure of that is
sw2834B-ms98-a-0088 453.675750 457.686625 you know her life sort of falls apart and she doesn't know who she is and she's
sw2834B-ms98-a-0089 457.686625 460.080625 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0090 460.080625 462.378000 absolutely
sw2834B-ms98-a-0091 462.378000 472.216125 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0092 472.216125 478.545000 well you know i think that's that's really i think it depends on what part of the country you're in
sw2834B-ms98-a-0093 478.545000 490.572375 um i- i would almost just say that because you know down here in the south [laughter] you know a woman's role is a woman's role sort of thing and you know
sw2834B-ms98-a-0094 490.572375 496.733250 um oh yeah yeah and and i think that um
sw2834B-ms98-a-0095 496.733250 505.160750 you know career woman still have a [laughter-lot] [laughter-of] [laughter-problems] here with the good old boys here in Texas sort of thing making career moves but
sw2834B-ms98-a-0096 505.160750 517.270625 um you know in terms of women staying home and being appreciated for their talents um it's just like the way it it has been for years i mean you know
sw2834B-ms98-a-0097 517.270625 526.492875 since the days of the pioneers around here that's the woman's role and it and it's hard for her to um you know -[a]mongst her peers
sw2834B-ms98-a-0098 526.492875 531.600000 be appreciated i think sometimes but then i'm not there so i don't know that
sw2834B-ms98-a-0099 531.600000 546.260625 and i have women that do both and i see a little jealousy on the part of you know the woman what has two little boys and and she has an au pair which is a live in college kid working for her and then she has her business in the back
sw2834B-ms98-a-0100 546.260625 553.875875 and then my other girlfriend that has you know just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy all the time [laughter]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0101 553.875875 567.748750 and so i see i little bit of that and i always wish there was a balance you know with the one and and wish she could spend more time with her kids and the other gal [laughter-i] [laughter-wish] [laughter-she] [laughter-could] [laughter-just] [laughter-get] [laughter-out] [laughter-of] [laughter-Dodge] [laughter-for] [laughter-a] [laughter-while] [laughter-and] [laughter-get] [laughter-some] [laughter-peace] [laughter-and] [laughter-quiet]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0102 567.748750 572.835125 yeah definitely so you're right about that yeah
sw2834B-ms98-a-0103 572.835125 576.398750 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0104 576.398750 577.824750 and that's
sw2834B-ms98-a-0105 577.824750 582.166375 that's true that's so true how how did your daughter do it
sw2834B-ms98-a-0106 582.166375 586.866250 [silence]
sw2834B-ms98-a-0107 586.866250 588.174125 uh-huh
