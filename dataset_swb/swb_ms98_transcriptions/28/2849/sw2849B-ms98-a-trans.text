sw2849B-ms98-a-0019 69.597500 73.146125 uh going to the s[chool]- the the school uh
sw2849B-ms98-a-0020 73.146125 77.447000 well no no it's just if if it's not part of your culture
sw2849B-ms98-a-0021 77.447000 83.626750 and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for uh the first i had gone to a very uh

sw2849B-ms98-a-0038 153.009250 161.701125 but i would want a very very very clear majority because if the minority can be so vociferous whether you're talking
sw2849B-ms98-a-0039 161.701125 166.963625 this group or or any other group that that has a stake in something
sw2849B-ms98-a-0040 166.963625 173.139625 they can make as you said uh so well the a a few can make it so miserable for everybody else

sw2849B-ms98-a-0051 218.647125 222.331125 same as as any other part of the world really yeah
sw2849B-ms98-a-0052 222.331125 227.980500 i i don't i don't think it's really to their best interests to uh uh
sw2849B-ms98-a-0053 227.980500 235.398000 attain statehood as it is right now they have the best of both worlds they have uh representation
sw2849B-ms98-a-0054 235.398000 242.727375 but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do uh being that it's an island economy
sw2849B-ms98-a-0055 242.727375 252.362625 um everything is imported and yes the cost of living is super high but but they're protected in so many ways without having to to pay
sw2849B-ms98-a-0056 252.362625 254.461000 for the rights and privileges
sw2849B-ms98-a-0057 254.461000 260.388500 so so you know i [noise] i would just as soon a[nd]- a[nd]- and and
sw2849B-ms98-a-0058 260.388500 265.036125 i[f]- if they voted to for independence i would back them a hundred percent and that's
sw2849B-ms98-a-0059 265.036125 271.224875 that's because_1 i i guess because_1 i'm not into territorialism or whatever that we have been in the past
sw2849B-ms98-a-0060 271.224875 277.071875 [silence]
sw2849B-ms98-a-0061 277.071875 278.412750 right

sw2849B-ms98-a-0071 311.490000 315.859375 part of that though has been i think uh selected by
sw2849B-ms98-a-0072 315.859375 318.596625 by them in that that
sw2849B-ms98-a-0073 318.596625 325.345250 whereas they want the benefits of some of of what the continentals can offer they they want to maintain that
sw2849B-ms98-a-0074 325.345250 328.547125 um culture of theirs which which i understand
sw2849B-ms98-a-0075 328.547125 336.739625 and and so often when you when you bring in the advantages the resources and so forth there's there's a trade
sw2849B-ms98-a-0076 336.739625 337.782750 [silence]
sw2849B-ms98-a-0077 337.782750 344.183000 most of the people who that i that i know about who really uh would
sw2849B-ms98-a-0078 344.183000 352.837500 f[avor]- favor statehood have pretty much assimilated into the the continental states already or they have family here and
sw2849B-ms98-a-0079 352.837500 360.014125 this way they can go back and forth and and it's not that much of a strain and you know they're kind of lackadaisical about it
sw2849B-ms98-a-0080 360.014125 364.425000 at least at the present time that's the way the way the pendulum seems to be swinging right now

sw2849B-ms98-a-0105 483.103000 485.923875 passionate about their beliefs
sw2849B-ms98-a-0106 485.923875 491.394375 but it it it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see i couldn't see that there was a clear majority
sw2849B-ms98-a-0107 491.394375 494.275375 that that stayed it seemed to shift a[s]- as
