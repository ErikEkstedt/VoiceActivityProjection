sw2849A-ms98-a-0012 32.656375 39.677000 and it was a a cultural shock to me uh in terms of what i went through the high school's now called R[oberto]- in fact
sw2849A-ms98-a-0013 39.677000 43.335000 it was called Tulley High School and now it's called Roberto Clemente

sw2849A-ms98-a-0033 102.564125 107.715000 right i mean i give you and idea that i had um and i would say i would say the ones th[e]-
sw2849A-ms98-a-0034 107.715000 112.147750 the majority appreciated what they were having in this country
sw2849A-ms98-a-0035 112.147750 117.433250 uh but a lot of the ones that didn't e[ven]- even in the minority not in the sense of the cultural world
sw2849A-ms98-a-0036 117.433250 120.996625 were they made it worse for the other kids in school
sw2849A-ms98-a-0037 120.996625 125.012500 and you know [vocalized-noise] Chicago back then even had bilingual classes
sw2849A-ms98-a-0038 125.012500 129.086250 yeah and i mean i had geometry the teacher was from Cypress Greece
sw2849A-ms98-a-0039 129.086250 131.047375 and it was
sw2849A-ms98-a-0040 131.047375 139.689500 Spanish and English so if you can imagine how i even [laughter-go[t]-] but i mean uh i and i guess i look at it as an enlightening sense um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0041 139.689500 146.046875 but i think basically i think they should leave things the way they are right now i mean i don't really have enough in terms of an argument
sw2849A-ms98-a-0042 146.046875 149.327875 pro or con in terms of making any type of change

sw2849A-ms98-a-0050 172.381875 182.579875 and that's exactly i mean i can remember instances that uh wasn't as uh you know bad Lord i don't know how it would be today well i know what it looks like i've been [laughter-back] for a reunion
sw2849A-ms98-a-0051 182.579875 189.821000 it does yeah um but it's but it's an experience i wouldn't change i mean my husband um grew up in um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0052 189.821000 196.500500 majority uh Wasp southern Ohio you [laughter-know] so that um when he saw where i you know
sw2849A-ms98-a-0053 196.500500 202.681000 saw my later teenage years he was just i hate to say aghast because_1 that sounds so trite but he was
sw2849A-ms98-a-0054 202.681000 208.395875 and yet how did i turn out the way i did [laughter-turn] out and i said that's really irrelevant what you find is that um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0055 208.395875 214.683625 if you can talk to like i mean i learned a lot about the um Island of Puerto Rico from talking to these kids
sw2849A-ms98-a-0056 214.683625 219.355500 you know and you lived there so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor 
sw2849A-ms98-a-0057 219.355500 221.287000 like here yeah
sw2849A-ms98-a-0058 221.287000 222.662625 it's the same

sw2849A-ms98-a-0070 269.133625 274.035500 right right i i probably would say the something if i knew that in[tellectually]- intellectually
sw2849A-ms98-a-0071 274.035500 277.216875 that it was good and emotionally that the people there wanted it
sw2849A-ms98-a-0072 277.216875 279.657125 you know it's it's um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0073 279.657125 286.334875 i mean r[ight]- right now they have the privilege of voting with the United States don't they they count yeah as a principle that's what i thought
sw2849A-ms98-a-0074 286.334875 290.858750 um but i've also been down there i've we've traveled a lot to the BVI the British Virgin Islands
sw2849A-ms98-a-0075 290.858750 296.455250 so you always pass through San Juan in going to places like Tortola or Virgin Gorda i u[m]- um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0076 296.455250 303.623875 and it's just it's i think what they do need is an infusion of some of the United States um privileges some of our resources
sw2849A-ms98-a-0077 303.623875 306.524000 the educational the teachers the um
sw2849A-ms98-a-0078 306.524000 311.906250 academic opportunity you know i don't think we do en[ough]- do enough of a resource transfer if there is such a thing [laughter]

sw2849A-ms98-a-0099 372.807625 377.213875 no that's natural i just thought i'd ask that because_1 i wondered what you thought they might think
sw2849A-ms98-a-0100 377.213875 383.142875 because i really don't have any um personal or professional or familial ties down there
sw2849A-ms98-a-0101 383.142875 390.850500 i don't know the peop[le]- the the the that j[ust]- that's just children but the the [vocalized-noise] people that i went to high school with um i think the majority are in that
sw2849A-ms98-a-0102 390.850500 399.915125 the probably the generation yours and mine and the one right after us that um their parents did not want to acclimate to the United States um in terms of retaining
sw2849A-ms98-a-0103 399.915125 407.612625 um and my background's European heritage and their background it would be you know the we[ll]- i guess i would say the La[tin]- Latin or Latino heritage
sw2849A-ms98-a-0104 407.612625 414.381750 not speaking in English um having the children drive them_1 everywhere and these were not old people these were like in their early forties
sw2849A-ms98-a-0105 414.381750 416.998875 um and i always that always bothered me
sw2849A-ms98-a-0106 416.998875 422.591375 and then there were some children that i noticed as soon as all the kids were out of the high school i mean they went back to Puerto Rico to live
sw2849A-ms98-a-0107 422.591375 427.399000 you know they made enough money here and but on the other hand i guess it's all about choice [laughter]
