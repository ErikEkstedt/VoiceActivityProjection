sw2884A-ms98-a-0022 68.909000 80.628625 before we got married i had money in the bank i owned my own home i put in so much money each you know month towards long term savings you know like in uh mutual funds and things you know
sw2884A-ms98-a-0023 80.628625 85.104250 and uh after i got married no it just didn't work anymore
sw2884A-ms98-a-0024 85.104250 96.075875 uh she spends a lot she likes to spend on anything and everything [laughter] with body lotion [laughter] everything so we really haven't uh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0025 96.075875 103.096500 we don't have a good organized system yet maybe after awhile i'll rub off on her or something [laughter] i don't thi[nk]-

sw2884A-ms98-a-0041 152.863000 163.052625 yeah see i think we might have to do that [laughter] because_1 she looks at what she brings home each week i it's going to be really hard for her to uh not have her own money
sw2884A-ms98-a-0042 163.052625 174.649875 because_1 like now you know i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years and now she wants to go back to school but she saved enough maybe to get her through August
sw2884A-ms98-a-0043 174.649875 188.448875 you know and that's it even and i keep saying now Laura you're going to have to save a little money i don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through it doesn't work Ken [laughter] my mother always said don't argue about money so we don't
sw2884A-ms98-a-0044 188.448875 197.229375 uh but uh but you know uh there goes my savings [laughter] but you know i it's one of those things i[t's]-
sw2884A-ms98-a-0045 197.229375 201.820375 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0046 201.820375 206.244625 yeah now see my wife will do things like make clothes
sw2884A-ms98-a-0047 206.244625 220.345000 uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and she's already made you know presents and gifts and things
sw2884A-ms98-a-0048 220.345000 227.881125 for shorts for me and things for the summer you know so i guess i can't you know we've probably almost paid off the sewing machine with uh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0049 227.881125 238.773000 yeah the savings from that so i can't complain too much you know she she's good about that and also we we dine at home a lot you know she likes to cook so that saves us from restaurants or whatever but
sw2884A-ms98-a-0050 238.773000 246.087875 but she does have things where she likes to pamper herself that just to me seem like m[oney]- money dumped down a drain you know
sw2884A-ms98-a-0051 246.087875 247.840000 yeah
sw2884A-ms98-a-0052 247.840000 253.573250 [silence]

sw2884A-ms98-a-0054 254.780000 256.631125 yeah but you need a hobby
sw2884A-ms98-a-0055 256.631125 259.062375 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0056 259.062375 260.961000 yeah that's true yeah
sw2884A-ms98-a-0057 260.961000 265.100000 [laughter] i know and those nails are so expensive
sw2884A-ms98-a-0058 265.100000 272.493375 [laughter] oh gosh i was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore i guess she just stopped polishing them_1 because they were yellow
sw2884A-ms98-a-0059 272.493375 286.627125 and then she waits for them to get their color back and then she'll polish them again i don't know whatever so she stopped for awhile boy what a difference they buy nail polish every two weeks it's [laughter] uh gosh and lotion oh my goodness body lotion
sw2884A-ms98-a-0060 286.627125 294.107375 we spend more on on soft bo[dy]- on on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things
sw2884A-ms98-a-0061 294.107375 295.264375 than
sw2884A-ms98-a-0062 295.264375 300.619500 uh she must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year
sw2884A-ms98-a-0063 300.619500 302.192875 and so
sw2884A-ms98-a-0064 302.192875 304.599500 [laughter] yeah it's funny
sw2884A-ms98-a-0065 304.599500 306.083875 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0066 306.083875 309.056000 oh i think so she's always soft that's true
sw2884A-ms98-a-0067 309.056000 311.276750 yeah yeah
sw2884A-ms98-a-0068 311.276750 319.123375 yeah but i i think um i don't know maybe after uh we're not in school anymore we'll be much better at saving i think uh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0069 319.123375 320.779625 i think that's uh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0070 320.779625 321.932250 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0071 321.932250 325.010750 i sold my house and that's what's really paying for my
sw2884A-ms98-a-0072 325.010750 334.626625 uh time unemployed or whatever you know because the graduate assistantship really doesn't cover the ten thousand dollars in tuition really doesn't cover living expenses
sw2884A-ms98-a-0073 334.626625 343.247250 uh now well we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job so that makes it hard um with you know we're paying double rent and double utilities
sw2884A-ms98-a-0074 343.247250 357.267750 and that makes it sort of expensive but see i live within my i live within my [meniar/menial] me[nial]- [laughter] very menial income and she doesn't [laughter] she doesn't live within her her professional income you know so i just get a
sw2884A-ms98-a-0075 357.267750 367.952000 yeah a[nd]- and then even if we want to see each other on weekends it's twenty five thirty dollars in gas every weekend and that really adds up too you know so
sw2884A-ms98-a-0076 367.952000 370.754875 it uh it gets tough but i
sw2884A-ms98-a-0077 370.754875 378.574500 i think we'll do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone you know w[ell]- it'll cut our telephone bills
sw2884A-ms98-a-0078 378.574500 391.289500 you know yeah by fi[ve]- by four fifths you know if if if she's here so it's it's actually tough this year but it'll be better in June she'll be move live together in June so hopefully our budget will in increase then
sw2884A-ms98-a-0079 391.289500 393.949500 no just since December
sw2884A-ms98-a-0080 393.949500 395.054750 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0081 395.054750 401.473875 yeah yeah we're [vocalized-noise] very newlyweds and but that's the you know we were together for probably um
sw2884A-ms98-a-0082 401.473875 411.298875 uh very close for about six months before we got married so you know we lived within uh though i owned held had my own house and things you know we still uh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0083 411.298875 417.246125 we're still pretty close and i knew her spending habits and and they're about the same they haven't changed at all you know
sw2884A-ms98-a-0084 417.246125 429.423500 [laughter] my mother always said to me Tom now the best thing to do is be like you're father never say a word when you're wife spends money and i was like well that's true my dad never said a word you know yeah so
sw2884A-ms98-a-0085 429.423500 430.703250 [silence]

sw2884A-ms98-a-0090 443.237000 448.628625 yeah i don't i don't argue with her but i just get all i guess i i it must show on my face
sw2884A-ms98-a-0091 448.628625 460.862375 you know must be like [noise] like must be cringes or something you know um especially l[ike]- yesterday or this past weekend we met half way between at uh at her parents house and um
sw2884A-ms98-a-0092 460.862375 472.948625 she had on a new pair of jeans and she'd gotten all new underwear and i was like [noise] Laura [laughter] how did you get all this stuff she goes well i just got paid and [laughter-and] i was like oh
sw2884A-ms98-a-0093 472.948625 484.973375 yeah it was there it was burning it had to be spent you know bu[t]- she said everything was on sale and i'm like oh oh that's good at least it was on sale that's good honey i'm glad you bought it on sale [laughter] what else can you say
sw2884A-ms98-a-0094 484.973375 487.105750 [silence]
sw2884A-ms98-a-0095 487.105750 488.477375 yeah i think

sw2884A-ms98-a-0103 502.364750 515.137250 yeah see i i was when i had when i was living alone and i had my own house and things uh you know i put one i was paid twice a month one paycheck went into savings and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage
sw2884A-ms98-a-0104 515.137250 524.673625 and the food bills and it and i was even able to you know to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account because i'm pretty thrifty and you know
sw2884A-ms98-a-0105 524.673625 528.525875 but my wife likes to spend she enjoys so that's fine
sw2884A-ms98-a-0106 528.525875 532.051750 [laughter] but uh for savings i'll have to look into that
