sw2884B-ms98-a-0131 543.804250 553.904000 where it was it was pathe[tic]- i mean it was horrible i mean half the half the city owned trees or or or or half the one third of of of all the vegetation in this county is just wiped out

sw2884B-ms98-a-0134 557.984125 563.627875 and our um we had to trim our backyard that tremendous willow tree that is
sw2884B-ms98-a-0135 563.627875 577.920000 it fortunately we didn't have to bring it down all the way but it cost us you know a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down i mean just to take off what was broken there plus we went and lived with friends you know this and that and and then the whole ice storm cost us still quite a bit of money even though insurance picked up some of it
sw2884B-ms98-a-0136 577.920000 584.633750 still not all of it they don't get you know and that plus and then we had a car expense like that same week one of the cars died you know
sw2884B-ms98-a-0137 584.633750 588.625750 all those things then they add up and that force savings really comes in handy then
