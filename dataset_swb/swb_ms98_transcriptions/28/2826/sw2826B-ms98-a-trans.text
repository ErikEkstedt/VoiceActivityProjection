sw2826B-ms98-a-0007 31.648375 38.318500 so uh i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing
sw2826B-ms98-a-0008 38.318500 44.860875 and the pressures on the children uh you know you hear this as an excuse but it's true they are so much greater
sw2826B-ms98-a-0009 44.860875 51.384125 oh i cannot believe uh what they're doing uh academically the demands on them
sw2826B-ms98-a-0010 51.384125 54.499125 and uh and i can see why children do drop out
sw2826B-ms98-a-0011 54.499125 57.390625 i can see i can see uh you know

sw2826B-ms98-a-0017 74.223625 79.643000 it's uh it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now in this area
sw2826B-ms98-a-0018 79.643000 86.415875 things were um similar because twenty years ago let's see it was after
sw2826B-ms98-a-0019 86.415875 94.848750 yeah twenty twenty five years ago is when we had the Washington riots the first rights we've been having some problem now and it reminded me of that

sw2826B-ms98-a-0031 125.870250 133.378375 the Washington riots weren't because i lived right downtown Washington and uh and what you saw is was what you got [laughter-i'm] [laughter-telling] [laughter-you]
sw2826B-ms98-a-0032 133.378375 141.165000 yeah but you know it's it is interesting uh they're so many m[ore]- they're different kind of dangers that face young people now
sw2826B-ms98-a-0033 141.165000 151.298625 and social pressures uh the pressures of drug is so much the prevalence is so much greater the the kinds of diseases that you've got out the
sw2826B-ms98-a-0034 151.298625 155.948750 uh i mean the consequences is so much what's going on is so much more serious
sw2826B-ms98-a-0035 155.948750 158.609125 then when we were younger
sw2826B-ms98-a-0036 158.609125 183.124875 [silence]

sw2826B-ms98-a-0044 212.713875 213.776375 [silence]
sw2826B-ms98-a-0045 213.776375 220.846250 i also being involved in the school system see so many of problem children coming from their parents 
sw2826B-ms98-a-0046 220.846250 231.560750 um children who will lie and cheat and you approach their parents and their parents are constantly justify them rather than to
sw2826B-ms98-a-0047 231.560750 243.400000 uh you know they're constantly uh [vocalized-noise] uh excusing their child and you can see exactly why the child is that way you can as a teacher can't hold a child accountable
sw2826B-ms98-a-0048 243.400000 246.447000 if you're not going to get reinforced by that at home
sw2826B-ms98-a-0049 246.447000 253.857500 and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day what's not been done for fifteen or sixteen years at home
sw2826B-ms98-a-0050 253.857500 258.154125 and you're get you get mixed signals so it's it's not always the school's systems
sw2826B-ms98-a-0051 258.154125 261.187625 i think a lot of it is the families and
sw2826B-ms98-a-0052 261.187625 263.320250 the way you were mentioning yeah
sw2826B-ms98-a-0053 263.320250 264.587625 [silence]

sw2826B-ms98-a-0056 275.152500 278.850250 course life is a lot more complicated too in ways
sw2826B-ms98-a-0057 278.850250 283.447750 um the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained for now
sw2826B-ms98-a-0058 283.447750 290.939750 uh you know with farming being so mechanized uh people working on the family farm which was a traditional American way
sw2826B-ms98-a-0059 290.939750 298.515750 if that uh becomes less and less likely factory jobs are so much more um uh sophisticated
sw2826B-ms98-a-0060 298.515750 306.831000 and the kinds of knowledge that uh you know it it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force and some people just don't have it it's uh
sw2826B-ms98-a-0061 306.831000 313.631750 [silence]
sw2826B-ms98-a-0062 313.631750 316.127750 and you worry with you know the effects of
sw2826B-ms98-a-0063 316.127750 321.697125 the effect of drugs on the young children and the unborn children uh
sw2826B-ms98-a-0064 321.697125 328.866500 in terms of [vocalized-noise] what it's going to mean to a society in the future it's a some ways it's rather frightening rather
sw2826B-ms98-a-0065 328.866500 332.488625 [silence]
sw2826B-ms98-a-0066 332.488625 334.298125 it certainly is

sw2826B-ms98-a-0088 404.646875 411.580875 isn't that true that's why i'm working in a school system so that i'm home when they're home um

sw2826B-ms98-a-0090 415.051125 419.702500 that's exac[tly]- isn't that that's so true uh uh i find working in a high school
sw2826B-ms98-a-0091 419.702500 424.116000 it's very helpful because it let's me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do
sw2826B-ms98-a-0092 424.116000 430.800750 and it keeps me from being the old foggy but at the same time it also it prevents kids from try to go pull the wool over your eyes
sw2826B-ms98-a-0093 430.800750 435.964625 as to what's come but that's the same i'm home at the summers i'm home with the holidays
sw2826B-ms98-a-0094 435.964625 442.360250 i'm home at three o'clock when the children are at home or where home one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college

sw2826B-ms98-a-0104 472.038750 481.501000 that's that is that is so true and it's not that always that the children always say something but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment
sw2826B-ms98-a-0105 481.501000 484.491875 and you realize uh it's important that
sw2826B-ms98-a-0106 484.491875 491.259000 and and yet you know we have to make that choice i think um twenty thirty years ago a lot of women [vocalized-noise] didn't have to make that choice
