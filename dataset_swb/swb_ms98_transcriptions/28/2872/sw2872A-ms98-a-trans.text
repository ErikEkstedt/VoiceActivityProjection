sw2872A-ms98-a-0051 245.658500 250.345500 lots of school principals seem to be women in th[e]- least in the Houston area
sw2872A-ms98-a-0052 250.345500 254.876250 i've noticed o[ver]- over the years that my kids were in school in fact
sw2872A-ms98-a-0053 254.876250 257.679875 fact i don't even remember any
sw2872A-ms98-a-0054 257.679875 264.183500 uh school that they went to that there there there wasn't a women principal from elementary school on up
sw2872A-ms98-a-0055 264.183500 265.100500 uh-huh
sw2872A-ms98-a-0056 265.100500 266.419750 [silence]
sw2872A-ms98-a-0057 266.419750 268.045625 so
sw2872A-ms98-a-0058 268.045625 274.391500 yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers
sw2872A-ms98-a-0059 274.391500 281.773625 seem to be women it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably it's because
sw2872A-ms98-a-0060 281.773625 287.939125 you know women go into teaching probably not so much for the money but uh
sw2872A-ms98-a-0061 287.939125 296.000375 for the satisfaction and that's just what they want to they want to do whereas uh i think if you're a college professor
sw2872A-ms98-a-0062 296.000375 301.317125 probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more
sw2872A-ms98-a-0063 301.317125 307.714000 well i don't know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level

sw2872A-ms98-a-0100 480.759000 492.902250 because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they don't care but you're you're finally getting to the point where it's just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it
sw2872A-ms98-a-0101 492.902250 502.299250 uh [vocalized-noise] can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw [laughter-it] [laughter-out] but you wouldn't
