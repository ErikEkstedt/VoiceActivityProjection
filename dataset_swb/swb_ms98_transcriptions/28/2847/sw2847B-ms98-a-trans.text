sw2847B-ms98-a-0072 347.263750 350.080500 you reall[y]- he's got a quite a collection of those but uh
sw2847B-ms98-a-0073 350.080500 364.440000 my stuff re[volves]- uh revol[ves]- revolves around uh one hun[dred]- one thou[sand]- let's see i've got one called One Thousands Practical Parenting Tips which teaches you to put elastic instead of [laughter-shoelaces] [laughter-in] [laughter-your] [laughter-kid's] [laughter-shoes] hey i've done that to every [laughter-pair] [laughter-my] [laughter-three] [laughter-year] [laughter-old] [laughter-has]

sw2847B-ms98-a-0077 385.869875 396.386750 since i'm um a therapist and all i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups so i've got all the different alcoholics what they call the blue the blue book the big book
sw2847B-ms98-a-0078 396.386750 403.677625 and all the OA literature and all the CODA literature so i'm trying to get famil[iarized]- more familiarized with that because_1 i refer clients and different groups and uh
sw2847B-ms98-a-0079 403.677625 406.980000 well let's see i'm trying to think of the
sw2847B-ms98-a-0080 406.980000 412.083000 [silence]
sw2847B-ms98-a-0081 412.083000 421.002750 um oh i def[initely]- i have a a love affair with John Bradshaw i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous
sw2847B-ms98-a-0082 421.002750 430.777750 um he started out with one called The Family which does the family systems and people's roles in the family and then he did uh Hea[ling]- Healing the Shame that Binds You
sw2847B-ms98-a-0083 430.777750 444.366375 about how shame can just be so paralyzing and people isolate and withdraw and then the third one that he came out with is now called Homecoming uh and uh there's a subtitle to it i never can remember what it is it's something like um A Journey
sw2847B-ms98-a-0084 444.366375 447.816000 In Your Inner Child or something like that
sw2847B-ms98-a-0085 447.816000 451.864875 [silence]
sw2847B-ms98-a-0086 451.864875 458.750000 oh he's just great and now he's had the the first the first one and the third one put into a ten session uh PBS series
sw2847B-ms98-a-0087 458.750000 461.689125 [silence]
sw2847B-ms98-a-0088 461.689125 463.005125 yeah

sw2847B-ms98-a-0092 472.789625 485.137250 i [laughter-know] yeah so people can just tape them_1 i guess you know [laughter] but i definitely have gotten a lot out of his lately he's just probably been one of the most there's an author that's in um
sw2847B-ms98-a-0093 485.137250 499.846375 that's in uh Arizona who used to be in Dallas it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in Texas called PM Melody who does a lot of writing on codependency and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and uh
sw2847B-ms98-a-0094 499.846375 508.748750 a workbook called Breaking Free and just some real uh helpful practical things for codependency so that's been another one that i've thought was real helpful but
sw2847B-ms98-a-0095 508.748750 518.083750 other than that uh my reading centers on Paddington Bear and [laughter] Winnie the Pooh and [laughter] Doctor Seuss [laughter]
sw2847B-ms98-a-0096 518.083750 528.849500 but i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because_1 there's so much more uh new things out that you know i i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids but there's such cute things out for kids
sw2847B-ms98-a-0097 528.849500 535.328000 oh i know and i just go to the library because_1 i just they're expensive i mean it and they go through them_1 so fast you know
sw2847B-ms98-a-0098 535.328000 546.710125 so i just i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out and they just love to sit and read and now finally the littlest one is old enough to to sit you know and watch the pictures instead of [laughter-grabbing] it and trying to rip the [laughter-pages] [laughter-out]
sw2847B-ms98-a-0099 546.710125 551.878375 so that has been fun to do that you know go through the children's literature and uh
