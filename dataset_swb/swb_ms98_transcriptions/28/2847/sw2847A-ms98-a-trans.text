sw2847A-ms98-a-0033 144.517875 151.778750 no we don't uh normally we don't publish uh things under our own imprint uh
sw2847A-ms98-a-0034 151.778750 162.218375 we have had books that are written here that are then published by all sorts of different uh commercial and academic publishers and university presses
sw2847A-ms98-a-0035 162.218375 171.208625 so uh i end up sometimes reading the things that are written here all the way through sometimes just a few chapters because that's as far as they get
sw2847A-ms98-a-0036 171.208625 177.102375 but i also get of course lots of references to neat stuff to read about
sw2847A-ms98-a-0037 177.102375 188.446375 so i'm uh i was just thinking when they told me the topic i should just i should read the uh titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of
sw2847A-ms98-a-0038 188.446375 202.151750 [laughter] i'm reading uh Within the Plantation Household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations
sw2847A-ms98-a-0039 202.151750 209.780000 uh a book called Poisons of the Past which is about ergotisms that uh fungus that grows on rye
sw2847A-ms98-a-0040 209.780000 217.456750 it causes the uh uh Saint Anthony's Fire Disease where people fell into fits and
sw2847A-ms98-a-0041 217.456750 225.572750 there is a a theory at least that a lot of people who were accused of witchcraft were actually under the influence of ergot
sw2847A-ms98-a-0042 225.572750 231.033250 and a book called Job Cues Gender Cues which explains
sw2847A-ms98-a-0043 231.033250 241.834125 uh how certain professions and vocations get uh flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other like uh nursing
sw2847A-ms98-a-0044 241.834125 248.044750 started out all men and then in the nineteenth century began to have women and now it's practically all women
sw2847A-ms98-a-0045 248.044750 249.946250 and that uh
sw2847A-ms98-a-0046 249.946250 253.036125 [silence]
sw2847A-ms98-a-0047 253.036125 258.085375 that's right and the thing that changed that was the manual typewriter
sw2847A-ms98-a-0048 258.085375 264.503625 but then it became you see just sort of a clerical task whereas when you wrote it out in long hand you were a
sw2847A-ms98-a-0049 264.503625 268.180000 yes you were a confidential assistant to the person
sw2847A-ms98-a-0050 268.180000 271.236500 [silence]
sw2847A-ms98-a-0051 271.236500 272.760000 right
sw2847A-ms98-a-0052 272.760000 284.970125 and then i've got a book called Fashions in Science which is a sociology that explains uh why certain theories get to be popular in uh sociology and
sw2847A-ms98-a-0053 284.970125 293.125875 uh how difficult it is to swim against the tide if you have a different idea that isn't vatted by your peers
sw2847A-ms98-a-0054 293.125875 298.675875 and then i have one novel that's called First Light that's about uh archeology
sw2847A-ms98-a-0055 298.675875 304.026375 the British novel so it's it's really quite interesting i haven't got too far into it yet
sw2847A-ms98-a-0056 304.026375 306.770000 [silence]
sw2847A-ms98-a-0057 306.770000 312.803875 uh those are all books that are out uh published and bound now but they're just things that
sw2847A-ms98-a-0058 312.803875 324.121875 uh pertain to various things i'm working on or were uh mentioned prominently and attracted my curiosity so i got them_1 out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them
sw2847A-ms98-a-0059 324.121875 327.086625 [silence]
sw2847A-ms98-a-0060 327.086625 334.463375 so i read a lot of history and uh a few novels an occasional mystery stories just for fun
