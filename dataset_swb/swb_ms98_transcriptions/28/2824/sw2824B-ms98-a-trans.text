sw2824B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.310000 the invasion of privacy is a topic that gets some people kind of mad i don't mind it too much uh it's more of a bother sometimes than it is uh a real invasion to me
sw2824B-ms98-a-0002 11.310000 19.936375 in that uh some of the purchases that you make if you make them with a credit card in a given location for a given amount all that stuff goes into a
sw2824B-ms98-a-0003 19.936375 31.532750 big computer data base and tends to go to the marketing schemes and then they will hound you forever for a particular purchase like that uh one of the the uh
sw2824B-ms98-a-0004 31.532750 43.691000 cards little little card i answered in the mail that had a bunch of topics would you be interested in this be interested in that an it was kind of a little survey type deal and i checked off a few things and
sw2824B-ms98-a-0005 43.691000 49.562375 just out of curiosity once i decided to see what would happen if i if i checked off uh
sw2824B-ms98-a-0006 49.562375 55.096125 about some stock uh portfolio information as it were f[or]- the different investors
sw2824B-ms98-a-0007 55.096125 69.343250 and within about a month i would say i had ten fifteen calls from different brokers uh asking me questions all sorts of things about what i would be wi[lling]- interested in investing in and how much i had to invest and
sw2824B-ms98-a-0008 69.343250 80.994000 and i was kind of curious and i guess i got my answer but it was uh a bit much and to this day it has continued considerably it's i guess it's going to be hard to get off of that little list now
sw2824B-ms98-a-0009 80.994000 84.347125 uh [noise] other little forms of of uh
sw2824B-ms98-a-0010 84.347125 98.519125 not really an invasion it's public record it's it's not uh not even they never told you it would be considered private but whenever you buy a house uh the purchase price is there for everybody to see where it's located is there and
sw2824B-ms98-a-0011 98.519125 106.710750 and uh companies that do this kind of research hire people to sit there at the at the records office and
sw2824B-ms98-a-0012 106.710750 115.351750 take down all this this information and put it into their format so that they can put it on to their computer and and know that a given
sw2824B-ms98-a-0013 115.351750 130.347375 neighborhood is at a given age group they they know a lot about you for the on that one transaction and they know roughly what your income is if you're affording a house of that size so they want to send you literature for vacations to whatever because you're in that bracket
sw2824B-ms98-a-0014 130.347375 138.801500 and marketing is uh seems to be the driving factor for most of these invasions of privacy as people call them_1 so
sw2824B-ms98-a-0015 138.801500 140.393125 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0016 140.393125 141.669625 yeah
sw2824B-ms98-a-0017 141.669625 148.119375 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0018 148.119375 157.957625 yeah that's true i- i guess that's uh where the old answering machine comes into play just screen a hundred percent of your calls and you don't [laughter-have] [laughter-that] that problem
sw2824B-ms98-a-0019 157.957625 160.486375 [noise]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0020 160.486375 161.964375 yeah
sw2824B-ms98-a-0021 161.964375 163.712000 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0022 163.712000 166.991875 that's the way to do it yeah
sw2824B-ms98-a-0023 166.991875 181.719875 well the other some of the other problems of course are are uh invasions that are more along the lines of theft where people have allowed their carbon copies of their uh cards to get a way from them the credit cards purchases and
sw2824B-ms98-a-0024 181.719875 192.287250 people will uh take those and maybe steal some something off that number or just use that that information as uh you you purchased this then you know at that time
sw2824B-ms98-a-0025 192.287250 200.961250 because that information is not always open to the public yeah you can't always get out and find every transaction that a person makes on their MasterCard of Visa
sw2824B-ms98-a-0026 200.961250 204.271750 but uh a lot of of um
sw2824B-ms98-a-0027 204.271750 215.326125 [noise] credit references uh when you dial that in to find out well what's their latest rating uh that kind of information you don't always want everybody to know but uh
sw2824B-ms98-a-0028 215.326125 221.847500 it's going across uh computer lines and people can pick up what they want so
sw2824B-ms98-a-0029 221.847500 228.757000 and then there's the whole issue of of uh cellular telephones and and house portable phones
sw2824B-ms98-a-0030 228.757000 240.773250 uh people consider that an invasion of privacy to have uh someone listening in on their their phones and ironically the laws have has classified one of them as illegal to listen to and the other one not
sw2824B-ms98-a-0031 240.773250 244.653500 [laughter-so] it's kind of a strange deal do you have a phone that uh
sw2824B-ms98-a-0032 244.653500 254.989000 people cordless that people can listen in on i don't either but uh i- i happen to have a radio that will pick up that range [noise] it it's very seldom that you can get
sw2824B-ms98-a-0033 254.989000 269.590250 uh you just happen to be within a couple of houses of that person and you have to listen at the exact right time and it's fairly {staticky} and on occasion you'll get two to three of them_1 at once because the radios usually don't have the control that's needed to 
sw2824B-ms98-a-0034 269.590250 281.467500 screen them_1 out and it's not the worlds most interesting thing to listen to but uh it it can be done relatively cheaply and i guess some people for lack of anything else to do do that kind of thing
sw2824B-ms98-a-0035 281.467500 292.256500 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0036 292.256500 293.523500 right
sw2824B-ms98-a-0037 293.523500 300.598875 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0038 300.598875 302.006625 um-hum
sw2824B-ms98-a-0039 302.006625 310.688625 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0040 310.688625 311.956250 right
sw2824B-ms98-a-0041 311.956250 314.281250 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0042 314.281250 316.361750 yeah it's kind of sad when they [vocalized-noise]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0043 316.361750 317.914625 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0044 317.914625 319.339000 right
sw2824B-ms98-a-0045 319.339000 326.722500 [silence]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0046 326.722500 340.182750 it's kind of sad that they choose that number to identify you [noise] with because_1 there's very few you know some people use it just because_1 it's easy and it's unique and then some people use it to yeah you can now identify that person it's not quite so private anymore
sw2824B-ms98-a-0047 340.182750 348.985000 and uh i don't know i- very little of the information i give out really bothers me but as far as whether i care if anybody else had it
sw2824B-ms98-a-0048 348.985000 363.104750 but uh i guess the idea that if you ever let it become a an all right thing to do for the masses then you'll never be able to get that privilege back [laughter] once gone it's going to be gone forever
sw2824B-ms98-a-0049 363.104750 364.517875 so [noise]
sw2824B-ms98-a-0050 364.517875 366.755750 well i think we've
sw2824B-ms98-a-0051 366.755750 371.553000 just about covered the topic i'm going to go ahead and let you go i got to get back to work here
sw2824B-ms98-a-0052 371.553000 373.754625 talk to you later maybe bye
sw2824B-ms98-a-0053 373.754625 374.846625 [noise]
