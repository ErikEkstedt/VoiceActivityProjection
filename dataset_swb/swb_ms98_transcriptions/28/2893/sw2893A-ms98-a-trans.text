sw2893A-ms98-a-0018 71.915250 74.498500 i would think
sw2893A-ms98-a-0019 74.498500 77.264000 it was just a side benefit

sw2893A-ms98-a-0030 111.993125 117.336250 yeah i think i uh i enjoy it sometimes and there's other times when i just get tired of it and
sw2893A-ms98-a-0031 117.336250 121.983125 and i feel like i'm obligated to do it because i've been doing it so i should keep up
sw2893A-ms98-a-0032 121.983125 126.067750 and there's some days it's just like it's the hardest thing in the world to

sw2893A-ms98-a-0048 174.989625 177.051000 i think too i was
sw2893A-ms98-a-0049 177.051000 180.720875 i go to school too at night and last semester i
sw2893A-ms98-a-0050 180.720875 187.824625 had stopped working out because i hurt myself and started smoking a lot and you just those kind of things age you more
sw2893A-ms98-a-0051 187.824625 190.361375 right and
sw2893A-ms98-a-0052 190.361375 197.098000 right and you can't and then you know it just kind of feeds itself you smoke and then you don't work out because you
sw2893A-ms98-a-0053 197.098000 199.553375 yeah right and so i
sw2893A-ms98-a-0054 199.553375 204.896000 i finally quit because like i just all i was doing was going down hill fast
