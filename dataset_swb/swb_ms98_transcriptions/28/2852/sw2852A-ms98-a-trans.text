sw2852A-ms98-a-0099 334.762375 339.132125 and i found the also that uh i don't think that waitresses
sw2852A-ms98-a-0100 339.132125 346.253125 i yeah i was in a survey when i lived in Orlando uh had a was in a survey o[f]- restaurants and and uh
sw2852A-ms98-a-0101 346.253125 357.722750 the i a lot of the waiters and waitresses think you know when women come in that that women are lousy tippers and that's why they don't give them as good a service as they do a couple or something like that but i don't think that's true i think women
sw2852A-ms98-a-0102 357.722750 359.235500 to me
sw2852A-ms98-a-0103 359.235500 362.470125 [silence]

sw2852A-ms98-a-0106 365.971125 370.659375 well i find that women are more willing to give a good tip a bunch of women as
sw2852A-ms98-a-0107 370.659375 376.170625 uh couples or or you know [vocalized-noise] guys together probably
sw2852A-ms98-a-0108 376.170625 381.184250 i don't think they're that but tha[t]- they were on this survey they were saying that the
sw2852A-ms98-a-0109 381.184250 385.586000 that's the notion that women have i mean that waitress and waitresses had
sw2852A-ms98-a-0110 385.586000 387.054125 but uh
sw2852A-ms98-a-0111 387.054125 389.984250 [silence]
