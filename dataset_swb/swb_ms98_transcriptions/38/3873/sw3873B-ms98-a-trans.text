sw3873B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.726250 [noise]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0002 1.726250 7.195750 uh i don't now my children are all grown but they did go through the Texas school system
sw3873B-ms98-a-0003 7.195750 17.813000 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0004 17.813000 21.250625 yeah i guess it is [laughter-a] [laughter-little] bit do you
sw3873B-ms98-a-0005 21.250625 34.579875 uh yes but it was in a smaller town and uh it was in a town where i knew uh uh an awful lot of the people and kept track of them_1 and i think that made a difference i
sw3873B-ms98-a-0006 34.579875 41.111000 no they grew up in uh a town in uh north Texas in Sherman do you have children here
sw3873B-ms98-a-0007 41.111000 46.897000 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0008 46.897000 54.978500 well i think Plano has a fairly good system because uh well just looking by the uh uh some of the scores coming out
sw3873B-ms98-a-0009 54.978500 64.051250 uh my children well now we did not uh they did not go to school until uh uh junior high but they were in Sherman Texas
sw3873B-ms98-a-0010 64.051250 70.463625 and one of my cousins was the principal but some of the problems i see now is i think uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0011 70.463625 83.855375 some uh as i said my children have been out for quite a while but a lot of my friends have children and i can see a difference from between when my sons went through and what their children are doing and it seems to me that uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0012 83.855375 87.869875 they're they're spending less and less uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0013 87.869875 89.610500 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0014 89.610500 99.199000 uh well my children had to have a lot more respect for their teachers than i think th[e]- th[e]- the students now days do
sw3873B-ms98-a-0015 99.199000 102.483875 and i think there is the uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0016 102.483875 110.137000 that respect has has carried over and uh um they're they're not being taught respect
sw3873B-ms98-a-0017 110.137000 111.749250 uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0018 111.749250 119.077875 unless and i don't know what you can do about it other than you know that is one of the the [samp[les]-/examples] one of the examples i see
sw3873B-ms98-a-0019 119.077875 133.756000 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0020 133.756000 145.518500 no i think also too you're you're right in the fact i think parents there is a lack of participation among parents it's uh too often the school is used as a dumping ground
sw3873B-ms98-a-0021 145.518500 152.204875 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0022 152.204875 156.483500 yeah uh but you're right i hadn't thought about that but
sw3873B-ms98-a-0023 156.483500 165.433500 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0024 165.433500 169.052750 but uh well also you know
sw3873B-ms98-a-0025 169.052750 171.501375 they they don't go
sw3873B-ms98-a-0026 171.501375 175.521125 to the open houses to the the parent teacher you know
sw3873B-ms98-a-0027 175.521125 179.921250 there's just a very small minority of of uh parents that do that
sw3873B-ms98-a-0028 179.921250 198.147125 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0029 198.147125 201.264250 that is i think uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0030 201.264250 205.739000 one of the things that i see course this is uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0031 205.739000 220.035625 uh j[ust]- again an outsider view is too often that the school system is set up now uh based on the way it was for the last two hundred years on an an agrarian society uh culture
sw3873B-ms98-a-0032 220.035625 231.355750 and the life styles now like you said there are too many two parent uh working parents and uh a lot of them_1 work uh there is not your nine to five shifts there's a lot of shifts 
sw3873B-ms98-a-0033 231.355750 241.684125 and it's a shame they cannot set up school systems that uh are not based on a Monday through Friday uh kind of you know a job
sw3873B-ms98-a-0034 241.684125 250.933500 or uh i wouldn't mind seeing evening you know uh u[tilizing]- utilizing the schools uh opening up an evening uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0035 250.933500 253.990750 you know a morning school and an evening school
sw3873B-ms98-a-0036 253.990750 261.106875 that way the the buildings would but now i am looking at other areas where they're having problems with over crowding and uh
sw3873B-ms98-a-0037 261.106875 270.259750 course you you'd have to have more teachers for that also but you could utilize the buildings just as well and it would be based on the life styles of their families 
sw3873B-ms98-a-0038 270.259750 272.722500 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0039 272.722500 276.059375 so that's a you know that's just a possibility
sw3873B-ms98-a-0040 276.059375 280.335250 and again i think also a lot of times they they
sw3873B-ms98-a-0041 280.335250 285.105250 there needs to be more emphasis on some of your basic education
sw3873B-ms98-a-0042 285.105250 288.518125 uh reading skills especially
sw3873B-ms98-a-0043 288.518125 292.506375 [silence]
sw3873B-ms98-a-0044 292.506375 294.283625 oh yeah that's
sw3873B-ms98-a-0045 294.283625 298.850000 [silence]
