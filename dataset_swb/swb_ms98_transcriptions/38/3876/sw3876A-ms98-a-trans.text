sw3876A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.065500 [noise]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0002 1.065500 2.783250 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0003 2.783250 10.876500 well i definitely think we need to start recycling i think it has got to be an individual responsibility
sw3876A-ms98-a-0004 10.876500 19.317625 until i think if we wait uh which is happening until somebody says we have to do it it's gonna be too late
sw3876A-ms98-a-0005 19.317625 24.408500 you know i've heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand
sw3876A-ms98-a-0006 24.408500 38.873500 and that's not too far away but i don't know how it is there it's very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much i take my pap[er]- i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store and i can take 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0007 38.873500 43.544750 plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them_1
sw3876A-ms98-a-0008 43.544750 51.723000 and there's some fire stations i can take newspapers to and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait -[un]til i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile
sw3876A-ms98-a-0009 51.723000 54.252250 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0010 54.252250 55.662875 um-hum
sw3876A-ms98-a-0011 55.662875 59.876250 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0012 59.876250 72.514250 yeah it's very hard to find a spot and then i don't know if you notice even doing that the amount of trash we throw away is incredible bottles that ca[nnot]- glass that cannot be it could be recycled but there is no place to
sw3876A-ms98-a-0013 72.514250 73.947000 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0014 73.947000 85.087500 no we have a pilot program in Arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they're having people separate the garbage as the trash as they put it out
sw3876A-ms98-a-0015 85.087500 90.239250 and i think that's what it is gonna have to come to where we're just forced to
sw3876A-ms98-a-0016 90.239250 91.599000 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0017 91.599000 93.329250 yeah
sw3876A-ms98-a-0018 93.329250 97.905750 i think so it's just because they have to you know
sw3876A-ms98-a-0019 97.905750 107.485375 right uh-huh and i think it's going to come to that because some people will just not go to the it's a it's trouble for me to do what i do i mean i am willing to do it but 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0020 107.485375 109.147125 yeah
sw3876A-ms98-a-0021 109.147125 113.836375 yeah it's very difficult like our garage is always full of stacks of newspapers and
sw3876A-ms98-a-0022 113.836375 120.603625 so i don't know i think there needs to be more places i also have a real strong opinion in Iowa the state i'm from
sw3876A-ms98-a-0023 120.603625 134.430500 uh i believe it's gone up to a dollar now everytime you buy a container no matter what it is whether it is glass whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever you pay
sw3876A-ms98-a-0024 134.430500 139.512250 ten cents for it and then you take it back to the store and you get it back
sw3876A-ms98-a-0025 139.512250 140.976375 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0026 140.976375 145.895125 you're forced to and uh you also don't see the litter there people just
sw3876A-ms98-a-0027 145.895125 154.539000 it makes it worthwhile to take it back and i've just started drinking a new water called Clearly Canadian i don't know if you've tried it
sw3876A-ms98-a-0028 154.539000 160.711875 and they have on the ba[ck]- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that
sw3876A-ms98-a-0029 160.711875 165.079000 yeah well wh[at]- some of them are five some are ten cents i am looking at it right now
sw3876A-ms98-a-0030 165.079000 170.517875 Texas is not one of them see so i have to throw them_1 away cause there is no place to take glass
sw3876A-ms98-a-0031 170.517875 171.918625 so
sw3876A-ms98-a-0032 171.918625 174.792625 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0033 174.792625 176.155125 uh-huh
sw3876A-ms98-a-0034 176.155125 181.490875 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0035 181.490875 189.339375 okay do they save like the paper the[y]- they use like the office paper good because_1 there is a lot of waste there isn't there 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0036 189.339375 191.362500 right
sw3876A-ms98-a-0037 191.362500 193.152375 right
sw3876A-ms98-a-0038 193.152375 201.198000 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0039 201.198000 202.638125 right
sw3876A-ms98-a-0040 202.638125 204.069625 yeah
sw3876A-ms98-a-0041 204.069625 213.939250 something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage like i've decided Downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton
sw3876A-ms98-a-0042 213.939250 222.800750 you add water i'll i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later but i am going to stick with Downy because they were first you know i want them to have my business 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0043 222.800750 228.441625 and i think packaging could be done much better there is so much plastic that
sw3876A-ms98-a-0044 228.441625 231.788750 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0045 231.788750 240.456875 yeah yeah and i think it's just people have got to be aware unfortunately there are a lot of people that just don't care and they don't wanna think about it 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0046 240.456875 249.502750 and uh i just look at it as i don't want my grandchildren looking at me and saying why didn't you do something you know i want to feel like i at least tried [laughter]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0047 249.502750 252.614875 and i don't know it just may overwhelm us
sw3876A-ms98-a-0048 252.614875 257.665375 here when we run out of places to put it then we'll be forced to it may be too late
sw3876A-ms98-a-0049 257.665375 261.717875 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0050 261.717875 271.842875 very little that's another thing and if you've ever know like i know Amway i only use a couple things form Amway that it says this is burnable material well 
sw3876A-ms98-a-0051 271.842875 275.764625 that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it
sw3876A-ms98-a-0052 275.764625 277.158250 [silence]
sw3876A-ms98-a-0053 277.158250 278.548125 yeah
sw3876A-ms98-a-0054 278.548125 287.726000 and then just like the glass bottles th[at]- that says on the bottle i can get ten cents but not in Texas and there's no place i can take glass to
sw3876A-ms98-a-0055 287.726000 290.914625 so i still throw away a lot of glass
sw3876A-ms98-a-0056 290.914625 298.562000 yeah and then the packaging really grips me you buy something it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plas[tic]-
