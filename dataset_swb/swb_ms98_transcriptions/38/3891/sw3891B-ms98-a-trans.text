sw3891B-ms98-a-0013 62.985500 70.954625 [noise] i mean i hate to admit it but it's true they and they have a higher percentage of uh completely working models that get out to the public
sw3891B-ms98-a-0014 70.954625 82.041875 [silence]

sw3891B-ms98-a-0026 137.234750 146.428750 the lightning flashed in through the power and uh hurt something in it so it wasn't the set's fault at all it was just uh one of those circumstances
sw3891B-ms98-a-0027 146.428750 147.671000 [silence]

sw3891B-ms98-a-0037 189.254250 199.234750 of stores that have huge quantities of of uh clothes and articles and you know we've got Wal-Marts and G[ee]- Gee Bees and a whole bunch of things and
sw3891B-ms98-a-0038 199.234750 208.777375 i don't know how we can support all of those things and the an[d]- and the only way they can stay alive is to buy cheaper products so they can put them_1 on the market cheaper for the public
sw3891B-ms98-a-0039 208.777375 218.805375 and when that happens more of those products are likely to have uh inferior working ability and that's when you have to start returning them_1
sw3891B-ms98-a-0040 218.805375 220.540750 so
sw3891B-ms98-a-0041 220.540750 222.150250 yeah

sw3891B-ms98-a-0044 234.821250 239.391625 if it looks beautiful and it's well made but people can't afford it

sw3891B-ms98-a-0056 290.944000 296.961875 and it was a ma[tter]- i think it was more of the installation was part of the problem than the machine itself
sw3891B-ms98-a-0057 296.961875 299.522000 [silence]
