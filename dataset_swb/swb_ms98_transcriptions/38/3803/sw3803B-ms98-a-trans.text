sw3803B-ms98-a-0003 3.380375 12.040000 well uh sort of mixed feelings about it i guess uh uh i i s[ide]- i lean more towards the control side than than towards
sw3803B-ms98-a-0004 12.040000 19.856500 you know just the the free free arming um on the other hand i it's it's sort of an issue of of uh
sw3803B-ms98-a-0005 19.856500 28.543000 uh i'm not i'm not a great fan of of government control in general and so it's it's kind of a tough issue what about yourself

sw3803B-ms98-a-0010 48.114625 55.714625 i'm i'm sure yeah um so you would take a position where somebody without without a uh um
sw3803B-ms98-a-0011 55.714625 65.286875 [noise] [vocalized-noise] specific use in other words if they just wanted to have a a gun to have in their home uh you wouldn't you wouldn't like them to be able to do that is that

sw3803B-ms98-a-0016 89.773750 94.231500 [noise] yeah i i have i- i have the impression that that the
sw3803B-ms98-a-0017 94.231500 102.030750 the majority of the problems that we have with guns are not a[re]- are are probably not from the people that are are buying them through legitimate channels anyway
sw3803B-ms98-a-0018 102.030750 110.217500 um that may be wrong um you know i mean certainly there there are cases of of you know the children who find their parents' gun or something and and
sw3803B-ms98-a-0019 110.217500 117.675000 shoot a brother or sister or you know things like that that need to be definitely avoided and that's that's certainly within the channels right
sw3803B-ms98-a-0020 117.675000 119.334500 but um
sw3803B-ms98-a-0021 119.334500 127.554625 a lot of the the crime i think that goes on i i don't know to what the degree the guns are are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns
sw3803B-ms98-a-0022 127.554625 146.563750 [silence]

sw3803B-ms98-a-0027 153.657125 162.885000 uh-huh [noise] yeah i i mean i think uh some sta[tes]- or i i i don't know if anybody actually has implemented i think so um [vocalized-noise] at least there's been talk about doing uh
sw3803B-ms98-a-0028 162.885000 169.507875 you know like waiting periods and and things like that um and and uh
sw3803B-ms98-a-0029 169.507875 179.023750 you know i i think stuff like that [vocalized-noise] is perfectly good i mean basically if you if you don't intend to do anything stra[nge]- you know if you if you're buying it for legitimate purposes
sw3803B-ms98-a-0030 179.023750 184.377375 waiting ten days shouldn't be a problem you know and and things i don't know i've
sw3803B-ms98-a-0031 184.377375 192.546875 [vocalized-noise] you know i uh i don't own a gun and and don't really want [laughter-one] and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did um but on the other hand you
sw3803B-ms98-a-0032 192.546875 197.668125 know uh like i say i kind of kind of against government control in general uh
sw3803B-ms98-a-0033 197.668125 203.737250 [silence]
sw3803B-ms98-a-0034 203.737250 212.948750 yeah and i you know something about banning is that you know there there are so many weapons out there that it they're not gonna disappear anytime soon um and they're already 
sw3803B-ms98-a-0035 212.948750 221.908000 i know there's a ready market for them_1 you know in the s[tolen]- the stolen stolen guns can be sold i mean their first thing a a a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun
sw3803B-ms98-a-0036 221.908000 226.150375 right because uh because they they can be so easily sold
sw3803B-ms98-a-0037 226.150375 233.559375 and you know their their i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country but um it's not like they're gonna disappear all of a sudden
sw3803B-ms98-a-0038 233.559375 237.129000 um even if you do do a total ban on them_1
sw3803B-ms98-a-0039 237.129000 239.589375 uh-huh it's a real tough problem
sw3803B-ms98-a-0040 239.589375 241.865250 i i don't know i don't know where i
sw3803B-ms98-a-0041 241.865250 251.446875 really come down on it i mean i i grew up my father was a hunter right and that's and that's sort of almost a separate issue i think we've generally been talking about handguns [vocalized-noise] and that kind of thing right
sw3803B-ms98-a-0042 251.446875 253.553500 you know and
sw3803B-ms98-a-0043 253.553500 257.153500 [silence]

sw3803B-ms98-a-0048 269.658500 276.470500 you know we didn't have any we never had any handguns or anything like that we had you know had shotguns for for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that
sw3803B-ms98-a-0049 276.470500 285.180500 and you know it was a whole different thing and and gun safety was taken very seriously and it was you know i mean before we go hunting we we took safety courses
sw3803B-ms98-a-0050 285.180500 287.249875 [silence]
sw3803B-ms98-a-0051 287.249875 298.466000 [vocalized-noise] but it you know that's that seems to me just to be a whole another issue [noise] um you know the the thing that the [noise] i yeah i'm not certain that people are are are terribly concerned about other people
