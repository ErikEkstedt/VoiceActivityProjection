sw3803A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.594375 [noise] hi [vocalized-noise] what do you think about gun control
sw3803A-ms98-a-0002 3.594375 27.764875 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0003 27.764875 38.070750 well i guess that i would like to to say that perhaps someplace in the middle where people could somehow qualify or
sw3803A-ms98-a-0004 38.070750 49.761625 um have a legitimate use for the the the weapon i suppose because also living in this area the the problems in DC come home very quickly
sw3803A-ms98-a-0005 49.761625 63.981000 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0006 63.981000 69.196625 well i'm not so sure about that but i think somehow uh safety courses
sw3803A-ms98-a-0007 69.196625 75.896875 or i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school but somehow people
sw3803A-ms98-a-0008 75.896875 86.721375 i'd like to know that the people who had them_1 at least knew what the responsibilities were whether they followed them_1 or not you know at least there's the moral issue that they they knew better
sw3803A-ms98-a-0009 86.721375 91.097125 which is sort of you know flaky but still
sw3803A-ms98-a-0010 91.097125 116.957750 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0011 116.957750 118.494875 um-hum
sw3803A-ms98-a-0012 118.494875 128.271500 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0013 128.271500 140.326875 yeah i don't know this morning in our paper it there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in Virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license so he went over there and got a driver's license the same day bought three guns
sw3803A-ms98-a-0014 140.326875 147.233500 and went up to New York and sold them_1 for you know very high markups now in a sense that's a legal
sw3803A-ms98-a-0015 147.233500 154.854375 way of getting the guns but certainly the the purpose is not very legal [noise]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0016 154.854375 164.006250 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0017 164.006250 165.394125 um-hum
sw3803A-ms98-a-0018 165.394125 180.723875 [silence]

sw3803A-ms98-a-0022 191.493125 196.486125 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0023 196.486125 204.601250 right and i suppose com[plete]- uh you know c[omplete]- total ban would lead to more illegal weapons
sw3803A-ms98-a-0024 204.601250 221.251250 [silence]
sw3803A-ms98-a-0025 221.251250 223.035750 um-hum um-hum

sw3803A-ms98-a-0030 252.677500 262.312000 but that's true i mean some people grew up with guns in the house we never had any in the house so to me the you know the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing
sw3803A-ms98-a-0031 262.312000 264.321875 and i'm not sure that's good either
