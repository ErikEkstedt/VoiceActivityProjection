sw3815A-ms98-a-0017 56.452000 58.258625 right right
sw3815A-ms98-a-0018 58.258625 66.648250 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0019 66.648250 68.701250 um-hum um-hum
sw3815A-ms98-a-0020 68.701250 81.416000 [noise] well i guess i'm um more traditional in that i don't like p[ower]- [laughter] power windows or power locks because [noise] the people that i know h[ave]- who have them_1 always seem to have trouble with them
sw3815A-ms98-a-0021 81.416000 95.276375 and um [noise] so i don't i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work [laughter] and then i want you know good uh gas mileage and i want an air bag and
sw3815A-ms98-a-0022 95.276375 97.241000 uh i guess a good
sw3815A-ms98-a-0023 97.241000 99.731625 no i haven't have you
sw3815A-ms98-a-0024 99.731625 100.755875 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0025 100.755875 104.417250 somehow i just think you know i like the idea [laughter]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0026 104.417250 106.767875 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0027 106.767875 108.111125 right
sw3815A-ms98-a-0028 108.111125 111.123125 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0029 111.123125 113.271000 right that's a good idea
sw3815A-ms98-a-0030 113.271000 123.150125 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0031 123.150125 124.923875 [noise] um-hum um-hum
sw3815A-ms98-a-0032 124.923875 130.632875 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0033 130.632875 144.142125 [noise] well i actually i don't know a lot about different brands i tend to have you know my requirements like the last time i bought a car i- i guess i did sort of prefer American and my requirements were basically you know good repair record
sw3815A-ms98-a-0034 144.142125 146.422500 good mileage um
sw3815A-ms98-a-0035 146.422500 150.285500 [noise] and i needed air-conditioning and um
sw3815A-ms98-a-0036 150.285500 154.633000 [noise] can't remember what my oh i wanted uh stickshift
sw3815A-ms98-a-0037 154.633000 162.530125 and so i didn't have a whole lot of [laughter-choice] there was one car in all of the the metropolitan area that i could find that
sw3815A-ms98-a-0038 162.530125 169.802875 you know was sort of a medium priced car with a [laughter-stickshift] in it it it turned out to be a a Chrysler um [noise]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0039 169.802875 171.169375 Lancer
sw3815A-ms98-a-0040 171.169375 172.810500 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0041 172.810500 173.901500 yeah
sw3815A-ms98-a-0042 173.901500 175.137250 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0043 175.137250 187.207125 no a five speed and it basically it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up and so it had been on the lot three months and they were really eager to sell it
sw3815A-ms98-a-0044 187.207125 192.630250 [noise] so i guess in this area at least you know if it's not automatic it doesn't move
sw3815A-ms98-a-0045 192.630250 201.899750 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0046 201.899750 212.740625 well i just wanted it because again i had i guess traditionally always had a car that had one and i thought it would be more reliable
sw3815A-ms98-a-0047 212.740625 214.835500 um
sw3815A-ms98-a-0048 214.835500 227.683375 [laughter] i found that out [laughter] i mean you know the people would just sort of look at me like you must be crazy when you went in to and they asked and said that was the requirement
sw3815A-ms98-a-0049 227.683375 229.680375 [noise] so
sw3815A-ms98-a-0050 229.680375 231.435750 yeah
sw3815A-ms98-a-0051 231.435750 234.622125 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0052 234.622125 244.820875 well i'm not even sure all of them are anymore at least in this area not that i was looking for sports cars but [noise] now the people i've talked to [vocalized-noise] don't seem to have stick shift
sw3815A-ms98-a-0053 244.820875 247.356750 and so why do you like stick shift
sw3815A-ms98-a-0054 247.356750 260.260000 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0055 260.260000 261.647250 um-hum

sw3815A-ms98-a-0060 277.349750 278.585375 um-hum
sw3815A-ms98-a-0061 278.585375 280.940375 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0062 280.940375 287.893375 [noise] right and actually it's probably safer on you know uh long trips because it keeps you more active
sw3815A-ms98-a-0063 287.893375 289.127875 [silence]
sw3815A-ms98-a-0064 289.127875 290.574250 so
sw3815A-ms98-a-0065 290.574250 295.680875 [silence]
