sw3813B-ms98-a-0002 2.502875 4.696000 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0003 4.696000 8.610875 [noise] well [noise] for many many years uh
sw3813B-ms98-a-0004 8.610875 14.754250 my wife and i did have a budget uh we were both working at the time and so forth
sw3813B-ms98-a-0005 14.754250 16.427000 and um
sw3813B-ms98-a-0006 16.427000 23.379000 that we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and and other big bills taken care of
sw3813B-ms98-a-0007 23.379000 32.434500 uh we have a a budget but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial [laughter-situation]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0008 32.434500 44.907375 so it it's uh it's been helpful i mean yes having a budget is very very important and that did get us so that you know the house is paid for and uh other major things were taken care of
sw3813B-ms98-a-0009 44.907375 57.854500 and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did
sw3813B-ms98-a-0010 57.854500 69.014000 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0011 69.014000 70.989625 sure uh-huh
sw3813B-ms98-a-0012 70.989625 84.647375 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0013 84.647375 86.445500 um-hum [noise]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0014 86.445500 92.891375 i think i've i do that automatically myself i mean i unconsciously uh
sw3813B-ms98-a-0015 92.891375 106.832250 you know stay in a within a with a certain amount because i- i have enough food already stored here that i don't have to make any large purchase at any one time all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there
sw3813B-ms98-a-0016 106.832250 111.283250 as the salt goes out or we need sugar or [laughter-something] like that
sw3813B-ms98-a-0017 111.283250 118.008625 [noise] yeah we have two freezers and course we had a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff
sw3813B-ms98-a-0018 118.008625 127.292875 and we freeze a lot of that so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own per[sonal]- personal storage
sw3813B-ms98-a-0019 127.292875 141.289000 [laughter] well we we keep a little note pad on a on our wall wh[en]- if anything is absolutely out make a note of it and then uh the next time i go to the store why i pick it up and fill it up
sw3813B-ms98-a-0020 141.289000 147.962250 so it's it's worked very well that way at least that way we [noise] you know if each of us finds something is missing
sw3813B-ms98-a-0021 147.962250 151.671750 uh we put it up uh the other person might not know about it
sw3813B-ms98-a-0022 151.671750 155.815750 that way we can keep up to date [noise]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0023 155.815750 179.435500 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0024 179.435500 180.912250 uh-huh
sw3813B-ms98-a-0025 180.912250 185.214500 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0026 185.214500 189.715875 well actually it's more interesting too if you've got the time [noise]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0027 189.715875 192.712875 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0028 192.712875 193.958375 yeah
sw3813B-ms98-a-0029 193.958375 210.461250 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0030 210.461250 217.187375 sure well i think we unconsciously [noise] do the same thing excuse me my throat's not as clear today as it should be
sw3813B-ms98-a-0031 217.187375 225.723125 uh we are uh going to be traveling to Europe with a choral we sing with this so called Pennsylvania Choral and we make a two weeks
sw3813B-ms98-a-0032 225.723125 230.596375 tour of of uh foreign countries and of course that costs money
sw3813B-ms98-a-0033 230.596375 241.350500 so we uh each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure that that we gather together over a period a time enough money to to make this trip
sw3813B-ms98-a-0034 241.350500 244.655625 so th[at]- that is another way of uh budgeting
sw3813B-ms98-a-0035 244.655625 255.273125 and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it we uh just live a normal life but we don't throw any money away particularly we save it for this trip which is uh always very very nice
sw3813B-ms98-a-0036 255.273125 263.515125 [silence]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0037 263.515125 272.040125 [laughter] i do the same thing i have a whole pile of those things that i have found by parking meter [laughter]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0038 272.040125 275.057125 [noise] yeah
sw3813B-ms98-a-0039 275.057125 276.979500 yeah [laughter]
sw3813B-ms98-a-0040 276.979500 279.921625 well let's face it then when we talking budget
sw3813B-ms98-a-0041 279.921625 287.790375 it is important to to have a budget [noise] and uh i- i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the
sw3813B-ms98-a-0042 287.790375 292.583500 level of my ch[ecking]- checking account and i have a money market account also
sw3813B-ms98-a-0043 292.583500 297.681500 and uh i keep those levels up above a certain minimum
sw3813B-ms98-a-0044 297.681500 299.522000 and i'm always trying to
