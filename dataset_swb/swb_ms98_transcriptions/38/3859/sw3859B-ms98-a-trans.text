sw3859B-ms98-a-0004 18.481875 21.208375 [silence]
sw3859B-ms98-a-0005 21.208375 22.361000 yeah

sw3859B-ms98-a-0009 30.935375 39.449625 yeah they just uh i don't know what happened they just weren't getting any draft picks and weren't i guess they just weren't picking the right guy weren't right people
sw3859B-ms98-a-0010 39.449625 43.012125 [silence]

sw3859B-ms98-a-0015 51.452000 54.967625 yeah they uh he was loyal to a lot of those guys that
sw3859B-ms98-a-0016 54.967625 62.239625 helped uh helped him win those Super Bowls in the seventies and uh stuck with him too long and then i think the
sw3859B-ms98-a-0017 62.239625 68.121625 the draft uh picks did fall on hard times and they just never were able to get back to where they were
sw3859B-ms98-a-0018 68.121625 78.735000 but uh uh we've lived here in Dallas for about nineteen years and i've never become a Cowboys fan in fact i don't i just don't like them_1 at all but
sw3859B-ms98-a-0019 78.735000 81.131125 [laughter] i
sw3859B-ms98-a-0020 81.131125 86.849125 oh i like them better than the Cowboys i don't i just uh
sw3859B-ms98-a-0021 86.849125 98.386125 other than the Steelers i don't have a real a real favorite uh like the Eagles i like the Redskins but uh usually like the teams that the Cowboys are playing for the most part you're a Forty Niner fan

sw3859B-ms98-a-0040 162.756125 174.944125 right yeah well couple of those passes a couple of those receivers for Buffalo dropped some important uh passes too they it would have made might have made a little bit of a difference not much but uh
sw3859B-ms98-a-0041 174.944125 184.237375 i don't i- i just looked in the paper this this evening and trying to figure out when the last time the AFC won a game guess it was eighty four Raiders
sw3859B-ms98-a-0042 184.237375 188.894125 Raiders beat uh the Redskins i think as a matter of fact but boy it's
sw3859B-ms98-a-0043 188.894125 203.699250 i was thinking maybe they uh ought to just AFC ought to just give it up and uh when uh it comes time for the Super Bowl the NFC champ plays an all star team of the AFC teams that might be a little more interesting because_1 i'm getting a little tired of watching the blowouts in the uh
sw3859B-ms98-a-0044 203.699250 217.890875 [silence]
sw3859B-ms98-a-0045 217.890875 219.178250 right

sw3859B-ms98-a-0051 226.274125 227.883625 yeah well
sw3859B-ms98-a-0052 227.883625 234.411625 Buffalo twi[ce]- well they did get close last year they could have won last Buffalo could have won last year against the Giants
sw3859B-ms98-a-0053 234.411625 245.472125 but uh just seems like there's a big gap in talent between the or maybe in coaching between the AFC and the NFC because_1 it's like i said it's been nine years or eight years since they uh since AFCs won a game
sw3859B-ms98-a-0054 245.472125 256.906500 but uh i guess they're gonna somebody was saying uh s[omebody]- i was watching the game with some people they were saying that instant replay may be on its way out i guess they have enough votes to uh or not enough votes to keep it going
sw3859B-ms98-a-0055 256.906500 261.176625 [silence]

sw3859B-ms98-a-0062 279.345000 288.050000 um yeah i just don't like it it it delays the game it delays uh i don't know it it just kind of interr[upts]- interrupts the flow of things and uh i
