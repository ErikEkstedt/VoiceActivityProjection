sw3859A-ms98-a-0003 1.749125 4.577125 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0004 4.577125 7.727125 so did i no kidding
sw3859A-ms98-a-0005 7.727125 17.605375 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0006 17.605375 23.704875 yeah Chuck Knoll as a matter of fact uh did the coin flip in uh yesterday's Super Bowl
sw3859A-ms98-a-0007 23.704875 32.181500 he looks real good he certainly had a an unfortunate uh end to a brilliant career
sw3859A-ms98-a-0008 32.181500 37.800000 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0009 37.800000 50.829500 well that's what i think i think the the the sad thing about the Steelers is that they stuck with the crew a little too long and i think that's the the biggest problem for dynasties is that you just really have to cycle people
sw3859A-ms98-a-0010 50.829500 52.302750 um
sw3859A-ms98-a-0011 52.302750 67.527875 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0012 67.527875 69.132375 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0013 69.132375 75.580875 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0014 75.580875 76.993875 no
sw3859A-ms98-a-0015 76.993875 78.065125 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0016 78.065125 79.443250 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0017 79.443250 82.968500 how about_1 Houston uh Oilers any more appealing to you
sw3859A-ms98-a-0018 82.968500 95.067250 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0019 95.067250 96.308875 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0020 96.308875 97.312250 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0021 97.312250 111.853375 well i h[ad]- you know i was a Steeler fan and a Forty Niner fan um they've certainly built themselves a you know a great team as a matter of fact if they hadn't lost so many games early in the season i think they might have been a contender might have given Washington a game
sw3859A-ms98-a-0022 111.853375 118.775375 but uh they lost uh so many games early that they that their comeback made little difference at the end
sw3859A-ms98-a-0023 118.775375 129.792875 well Montana made a difference but as the ana[lysts]- analysts have said over and over again the game is won and lost at the line of scrimmage a smart quarterback makes a big difference and i really think for example yesterday
sw3859A-ms98-a-0024 129.792875 137.638500 Buffalo might very well have been in it until the end had Kelley been uh a smarter quarterback i- i frankly am surprised that
sw3859A-ms98-a-0025 137.638500 142.326375 um Marv Levy would allow him to call all those plays
sw3859A-ms98-a-0026 142.326375 157.253875 yeah and i think that's just too tough in a on a uh uh you know a guy i m[ean]- you got to be real real savvy to do that and i don't see Kelley as being that savvy i don't i think that's one of the weaknesses in the Buffalo offense myself
sw3859A-ms98-a-0027 157.253875 163.663750 because_1 they certainly have a heck of a defense although it was picked apart a little bit i mean Washington just looked phenomenal
sw3859A-ms98-a-0028 163.663750 165.296125 and uh
sw3859A-ms98-a-0029 165.296125 169.993375 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0030 169.993375 171.451500 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0031 171.451500 173.158375 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0032 173.158375 174.579250 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0033 174.579250 182.114750 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0034 182.114750 184.906375 it it's it's it's nine years ago
sw3859A-ms98-a-0035 184.906375 186.847875 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0036 186.847875 189.562125 yeah it's b[een]- been a while
sw3859A-ms98-a-0037 189.562125 198.332000 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0038 198.332000 201.418250 [laughter]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0039 201.418250 202.568750 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0040 202.568750 215.035625 well it is it is a little disappointing and there's some it it's very interesting to see you know what's what's behind this is it is it the uh i mean you would think theoretically that the the draft picks would uh
sw3859A-ms98-a-0041 215.035625 218.639375 you know random and then free agency also makes a big difference
sw3859A-ms98-a-0042 218.639375 228.766875 uh i don't understand it i mean they just uh they they Denver you know went a few times and they didn't do anything uh Cincinnati they didn't do anything now uh Buffalo
sw3859A-ms98-a-0043 228.766875 244.859625 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0044 244.859625 246.262375 yeah
sw3859A-ms98-a-0045 246.262375 256.165500 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0046 256.165500 262.750125 well you know i think that's sad in a way because i think if you look for example there were a couple of calls yesterday that were appallingly bad
sw3859A-ms98-a-0047 262.750125 270.057625 i mean i just it's it's it's shameful and and i think that that once Pandora's out of the box you know
sw3859A-ms98-a-0048 270.057625 281.587000 so i don't know i- i- i- i think it can complicate things i recognize that but i sure think it's it's reversed some some calls that were bad calls although yesterday it didn't reverse one that was a very bad call w[hat]-
sw3859A-ms98-a-0049 281.587000 286.613500 [silence]
sw3859A-ms98-a-0050 286.613500 298.946000 well there yeah the[re]- there is that problem an[d]- an[d]- but uh i guess that [laughter] that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when Andre Reid
