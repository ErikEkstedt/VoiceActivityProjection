sw3821A-ms98-a-0060 211.989250 218.496000 and have paid off their you know higher interest rate uh cards and just sent them back you know
sw3821A-ms98-a-0061 218.496000 230.206625 and i i guess there's some there's uh uh some negotiating there too because i heard uh on one of the local talk shows here they had somebody on and and said what you can do is uh
sw3821A-ms98-a-0062 230.206625 235.015000 call you know if you've got a pretty good rating uh credit rating
sw3821A-ms98-a-0063 235.015000 247.496000 you can call your in you know your your card uh wherever you got your card from and tell them hey either drop my rates or drop my you know uh annual fees or i'll just go to somewhere else 
sw3821A-ms98-a-0064 247.496000 250.505750 you know and if you've got if you've got a pretty good uh
