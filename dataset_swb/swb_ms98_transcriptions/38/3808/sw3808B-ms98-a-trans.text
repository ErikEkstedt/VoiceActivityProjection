sw3808B-ms98-a-0003 4.742875 8.322625 unnecess[ary]- a necessary evil i guess

sw3808B-ms98-a-0007 48.038500 51.391125 yeah uh i guess i'm uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0008 51.391125 57.108250 partly biased since we just recently our company's gone to the uh process of
sw3808B-ms98-a-0009 57.108250 60.534125 initiating drug testing on a random basis
sw3808B-ms98-a-0010 60.534125 62.539125 [silence]

sw3808B-ms98-a-0013 71.096750 72.495375 that's correct
sw3808B-ms98-a-0014 72.495375 76.711750 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0015 76.711750 78.380250 well it's uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0016 78.380250 83.207125 other than they uh they insisted on the uh you know management and 
sw3808B-ms98-a-0017 83.207125 87.897625 and supervision taking the uh being done within the first year
sw3808B-ms98-a-0018 87.897625 90.393250 which we've all been done you know
sw3808B-ms98-a-0019 90.393250 92.486000 uh seems to be

sw3808B-ms98-a-0021 93.511375 94.891250 the past year

sw3808B-ms98-a-0023 97.617125 101.126750 uh right act[ually]- late in ninety it was
sw3808B-ms98-a-0024 101.126750 106.599875 but you know they it's fairly infrequent it's just that it's there you know
sw3808B-ms98-a-0025 106.599875 110.382750 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0026 110.382750 112.956625 oh Lord no i don't think uh 
sw3808B-ms98-a-0027 112.956625 115.261250 first of all in my group 
sw3808B-ms98-a-0028 115.261250 118.277375 hardly a fourth of them have been tested you know
sw3808B-ms98-a-0029 118.277375 120.056875 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0030 120.056875 123.063875 uh it's about uh twenty people

sw3808B-ms98-a-0032 132.049000 133.707750 well

sw3808B-ms98-a-0034 134.902500 139.553250 that uh they want to you know social uh issues
sw3808B-ms98-a-0035 139.553250 149.292750 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0036 149.292750 150.914625 yeah i think that
sw3808B-ms98-a-0037 150.914625 155.383250 that was probably the prime motivation and insurance like you say to get uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0038 155.383250 157.189875 [silence]

sw3808B-ms98-a-0045 176.549500 179.138250 yeah i guess there uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0046 179.138250 182.981125 may have been just a committee throwing out suggestions
sw3808B-ms98-a-0047 182.981125 188.000000 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0048 188.000000 192.867250 it was uh it was received at our site here in Houston
sw3808B-ms98-a-0049 192.867250 198.924875 fairly easily however in Austin where they have a lot of engineers and uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0050 198.924875 206.456375 i guess a younger set uh people they uh they were pretty uh a lot of people quit over it and uh quite a
sw3808B-ms98-a-0051 206.456375 208.704250 quite a bit of furor yeah
sw3808B-ms98-a-0052 208.704250 211.494625 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0053 211.494625 216.109875 i guess yeah there was some people that just actually quit because of the
sw3808B-ms98-a-0054 216.109875 220.737000 their uh objection to the policy being forced on them you know
sw3808B-ms98-a-0055 220.737000 228.439875 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0056 228.439875 236.851000 uh i don't know how much of that there is i don't think it's that big of an issue because they've hired a national company and it's you know handled
sw3808B-ms98-a-0057 236.851000 240.286750 third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that
sw3808B-ms98-a-0058 240.286750 246.640000 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0059 246.640000 250.394250 oh yes they've they've they've been people that have been uh
sw3808B-ms98-a-0060 250.394250 251.930875 the company has a
sw3808B-ms98-a-0061 251.930875 260.749875 you get a two step process the first time if you're caught you have to uh take a uh you know go into a program to even if you're not you know
sw3808B-ms98-a-0062 260.749875 263.283250 still have to go into a program even
sw3808B-ms98-a-0063 263.283250 264.451750 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0064 264.451750 278.844750 yeah if you're if you're you're high you know if you fail the test whatever reason you have to go in into a program and uh course that can be very quickly taken care of if you're not a habitual user or whatever
sw3808B-ms98-a-0065 278.844750 284.850875 then uh after that first ti[me]- chance then the second time it's automatic termination so
sw3808B-ms98-a-0066 284.850875 295.042000 [silence]
sw3808B-ms98-a-0067 295.042000 296.725125 yeah well it's
sw3808B-ms98-a-0068 296.725125 299.394000 it's almost become a uh non topic any[more]-
