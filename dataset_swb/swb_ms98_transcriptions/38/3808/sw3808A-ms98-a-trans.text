sw3808A-ms98-a-0004 7.843125 16.391625 yeah i think that it's appropriate in some job categories uh jobs that involve safety and
sw3808A-ms98-a-0005 16.391625 27.108875 you know that that performance of which really would have an effect on the the the lives and safety of other people you know health professionals and people who
sw3808A-ms98-a-0006 27.108875 37.316625 uh operate machinery and fly and or drive whatever i think that those are really important i'm not sure how i feel about about other jobs just
sw3808A-ms98-a-0007 37.316625 42.083125 uh for the purpose of determining whether or not an employee is
sw3808A-ms98-a-0008 42.083125 45.414250 drug free you know on on general principles
sw3808A-ms98-a-0009 45.414250 48.336875 but i can really see the justification for the others
sw3808A-ms98-a-0010 48.336875 59.970750 [silence]
sw3808A-ms98-a-0011 59.970750 62.840250 uh-huh for all job categories

sw3808A-ms98-a-0015 71.289000 76.971250 a[nd]- and how do they how do they do that how often generally does random mean
sw3808A-ms98-a-0016 76.971250 91.424875 [silence]
sw3808A-ms98-a-0017 91.424875 93.433500 so in the past month
sw3808A-ms98-a-0018 93.433500 94.677375 [silence]
sw3808A-ms98-a-0019 94.677375 98.395125 oh since nineteen ninety one it started is that right
sw3808A-ms98-a-0020 98.395125 99.460250 uh-huh

sw3808A-ms98-a-0029 126.123625 130.325875 so what do you see as the reasons that they chose to do that
sw3808A-ms98-a-0030 130.325875 132.491125 that the company chose to do that
sw3808A-ms98-a-0031 132.491125 134.902875 was it insurance issue or
sw3808A-ms98-a-0032 134.902875 136.670000 safety issue
sw3808A-ms98-a-0033 136.670000 139.098000 [silence]

sw3808A-ms98-a-0035 140.688500 144.664500 so uh on a performance level there was actually
sw3808A-ms98-a-0036 144.664500 149.532875 a problem with abuse of substances and they wanted to make sure that they were reducing that or

sw3808A-ms98-a-0046 174.611875 176.818000 i often wonder who has created them
sw3808A-ms98-a-0047 176.818000 182.230500 [silence]
sw3808A-ms98-a-0048 182.230500 188.876875 [laughter] was the response from the employees regarding drug testing favorable or

sw3808A-ms98-a-0055 220.002625 228.774750 uh-huh is there some concern that the tests may not be completely accurate that you might be taking some prescription medication and and
sw3808A-ms98-a-0056 228.774750 230.976875 be interpreted correctly
sw3808A-ms98-a-0057 230.976875 239.111375 [silence]
sw3808A-ms98-a-0058 239.111375 241.193750 uh-huh uh-huh

sw3808A-ms98-a-0069 285.511500 289.119875 seems fair certainly if people are prepared for the fact that
sw3808A-ms98-a-0070 289.119875 295.917000 there's a chance they're going to be tested you think they'd be smart enough if they did have a problem to eliminate [laughter-their] [laughter-use] [laughter]
