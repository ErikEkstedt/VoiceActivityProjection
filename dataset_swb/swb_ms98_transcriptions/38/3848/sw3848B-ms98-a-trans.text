sw3848B-ms98-a-0020 72.977500 75.471375 and uh i think uh

sw3848B-ms98-a-0030 125.934000 133.123000 well it was something i don't remember the exact details so long ago uh they tried to sell me some kind of a special card
sw3848B-ms98-a-0031 133.123000 140.717625 you know gold card or super card or diamond card and so to do that they had to change my account
sw3848B-ms98-a-0032 140.717625 143.309125 and so
sw3848B-ms98-a-0033 143.309125 149.346875 some bills came in under the old account after they transferred all the money out
sw3848B-ms98-a-0034 149.346875 159.485000 and rather than credit you know move the bills to the new account and pay them off as they should they sent me this statement showing this huge interest charge on uh
sw3848B-ms98-a-0035 159.485000 161.194625 on the account
sw3848B-ms98-a-0036 161.194625 164.428125 and it took took me a while to get that straightened out
sw3848B-ms98-a-0037 164.428125 171.975875 [silence]
sw3848B-ms98-a-0038 171.975875 180.780500 yeah well i tried writing letters to get it straightened out but it uh it took about eight months and i finally said cancel the account and
sw3848B-ms98-a-0039 180.780500 184.311625 after about four months they quit sending me letters
sw3848B-ms98-a-0040 184.311625 185.476875 uh

sw3848B-ms98-a-0047 241.392000 251.734875 yeah well i have another credit card our company when you travel uh because of the tax regulations they don't like to make cash advances
sw3848B-ms98-a-0048 251.734875 263.576125 uh because there's uh they're concerned with the tax liability there so uh rather than make a uh cash advance they issue a credit card and you just charge as you go
sw3848B-ms98-a-0049 263.576125 265.250625 and uh
