sw3888B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.135750 [noise]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0002 1.135750 3.263625 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0003 3.263625 10.317000 uh well i guess we're not as bad as a lot of places but uh we're out here on the Great Plains so there's some place for it to go
sw3888B-ms98-a-0004 10.317000 15.357875 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0005 15.357875 16.943875 yeah
sw3888B-ms98-a-0006 16.943875 29.430250 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0007 29.430250 32.700000 yeah i've heard that
sw3888B-ms98-a-0008 32.700000 52.424125 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0009 52.424125 53.888500 um-hum
sw3888B-ms98-a-0010 53.888500 57.135625 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0011 57.135625 63.493000 yeah i think that's probably the problem with any of the coastal cities i think that's what New York has such a problem with
sw3888B-ms98-a-0012 63.493000 74.927375 you know the the the way that the air masses move around the the sea coast uh and it really just like making and stuff just hang over whatever cities happen to be on the coast
sw3888B-ms98-a-0013 74.927375 82.395625 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0014 82.395625 85.748000 i don't think it's as bad yeah
sw3888B-ms98-a-0015 85.748000 87.358125 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0016 87.358125 97.806000 i know there's some because in my visits to New York i noticed that my i wear i'm a contact lens wearer and i noticed that i have to uh take out my contacts
sw3888B-ms98-a-0017 97.806000 109.120000 yeah i can't wear them_1 as many hours during the day as i can other places but you know i mean that's not just New York i mean that's also Europe you know Rome is the worst city i've ever been at
sw3888B-ms98-a-0018 109.120000 114.870375 course now i hear that uh you now like Mexico City is real bad for that
sw3888B-ms98-a-0019 114.870375 119.559500 and also places in Brazil like Sao Paulo you know
sw3888B-ms98-a-0020 119.559500 120.867500 yeah
sw3888B-ms98-a-0021 120.867500 123.559250 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0022 123.559250 128.026500 well they have no they have no pollution controls whatsoever
sw3888B-ms98-a-0023 128.026500 134.684250 so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know
sw3888B-ms98-a-0024 134.684250 145.633500 they control nothing i mean it's like it's like you know the si[tuation]- it you know Brazil even though there's there's in Brazil uh i[t]- it's my understanding because i have some friends there that are Brazilian
sw3888B-ms98-a-0025 145.633500 149.793500 uh there's an upper-class and a lower-class and no middle-class
sw3888B-ms98-a-0026 149.793500 150.907250 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0027 150.907250 160.646000 and so you know the lower class is working uh in the factories which pollute the air and the upper classes make the money off of the factories
sw3888B-ms98-a-0028 160.646000 173.715500 and so pollution is a big problem for all of the you know underdeveloped countries because_1 they're not going to they're not going to start instituting regulations that are going to impede their whatever industry they happen to have
sw3888B-ms98-a-0029 173.715500 182.567125 which you know [vocalized-noise] that's [vocalized-noise] kind of going to be the end result you know Bu[sh]- i was reading in the Wall Street Journal today you know Bush's moratorium on regulatory
sw3888B-ms98-a-0030 182.567125 191.346250 uh things right now that are going to impede business the first effect that it has had is the EPA had some new regs up
sw3888B-ms98-a-0031 191.346250 204.151500 for um congressional approval that had to do with making industries uh itemize uh different types of things that they were you know
sw3888B-ms98-a-0032 204.151500 216.794875 putting into the air you know part of the clean air act you know which is to help enforce the clean air act and so that of course you know the moratorium on new regulations has you know hamstrung that
sw3888B-ms98-a-0033 216.794875 237.964250 [silence]
sw3888B-ms98-a-0034 237.964250 239.957125 absolutely not
sw3888B-ms98-a-0035 239.957125 253.589125 not any profit driven industry because you know they're just absolutely not going to you know sit still for anything that's going to take away from profits i mean we're we're living in the greed generation here i mean there is no there is
sw3888B-ms98-a-0036 253.589125 255.955625 sure i mean you know
sw3888B-ms98-a-0037 255.955625 260.656875 i mean i've hear[d]- i've heard that before and i'm now beginning to believe it because
sw3888B-ms98-a-0038 260.656875 273.136750 you know what i mean i have some limited involvement in some in some what you would call i guess environmental type entities i'm an attorney and i write letters for a number of environmental um
sw3888B-ms98-a-0039 273.136750 285.010000 uh purposes and you know it it is amazing to me that people can sit here and look at the situation that we have globally and say you know what the hell
sw3888B-ms98-a-0040 285.010000 297.538000 because uh you know it's it's really apparent to me especially living in a city the size of Dallas that the wide open spaces that where always the justification for why worry you know are going away
