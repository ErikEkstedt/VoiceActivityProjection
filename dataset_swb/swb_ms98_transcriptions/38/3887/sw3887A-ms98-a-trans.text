sw3887A-ms98-a-0003 1.524750 19.619875 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0004 19.619875 25.193500 yeah one of the things they asked me to ask you was where you thought the major source was coming from
sw3887A-ms98-a-0005 25.193500 26.563875 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0006 26.563875 28.363625 or sources
sw3887A-ms98-a-0007 28.363625 30.719125 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0008 30.719125 32.566875 that's what i would think
sw3887A-ms98-a-0009 32.566875 42.427875 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0010 42.427875 43.860000 right
sw3887A-ms98-a-0011 43.860000 47.824500 yeah i think the automobile definitely is an area
sw3887A-ms98-a-0012 47.824500 52.252750 uh any any industry that burns you know
sw3887A-ms98-a-0013 52.252750 56.377000 and then i don't know about chemical pollution i'm not real
sw3887A-ms98-a-0014 56.377000 66.936250 into that as far as how it affects the air i know we have a lot of chemical the indoor type pollution they have offices that are too well insulated they found people are getting sick
sw3887A-ms98-a-0015 66.936250 69.823875 but i don't know if that affects outside
sw3887A-ms98-a-0016 69.823875 79.621750 you know i- i think seems to think seems to me that's what they were asking about was outside and the thing i can the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories
sw3887A-ms98-a-0017 79.621750 80.865000 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0018 80.865000 82.010375 yeah

sw3887A-ms98-a-0028 122.260000 132.747000 i think something too that you probably see in older states all we we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces
sw3887A-ms98-a-0029 132.747000 135.473000 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0030 135.473000 137.449750 i think it will

sw3887A-ms98-a-0038 168.909750 179.342125 yeah in this area too since you know in Texas we're so spread out we have to drive so far but i know in Colorado i have witnessed that where it just uh
sw3887A-ms98-a-0039 179.342125 188.825250 it just stacks up at the when the Rockies starts but we're even getting it here we can drive into when we've been on vacation or something drive into Fort Worth or Dallas
sw3887A-ms98-a-0040 188.825250 198.107250 and you can tell it in the mornings too my husband likes to go out and jog and there's just a brown fog here and we don't even have any mountains that are holding it in
sw3887A-ms98-a-0041 198.107250 205.731500 but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together the worse it gets
sw3887A-ms98-a-0042 205.731500 208.761125 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0043 208.761125 211.841625 you don't have to have mountains there stopping it
sw3887A-ms98-a-0044 211.841625 217.325375 and uh they make uh making more and more high-rise buildings and uh
sw3887A-ms98-a-0045 217.325375 223.105750 so yeah we can comment and we didn't see this a few years ago it was pretty clear here
sw3887A-ms98-a-0046 223.105750 232.305625 [silence]
sw3887A-ms98-a-0047 232.305625 234.202875 right

sw3887A-ms98-a-0055 288.520625 297.762000 yes and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car just one person in that it's a lot of waste but
