sw3887B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.564000 [noise] well i guess we're uh
sw3887B-ms98-a-0002 2.564000 7.861625 forced to finally to do a lot about air pollution i hear that
sw3887B-ms98-a-0003 7.861625 17.546625 the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars and low polluting f[uels]- fuels are being experimented with ethanol and
sw3887B-ms98-a-0004 17.546625 19.871750 other types of fuels
sw3887B-ms98-a-0005 19.871750 24.781875 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0006 24.781875 32.018500 i you know i assume that the major sources are cars and factories but i
sw3887B-ms98-a-0007 32.018500 43.250250 i don't know for sure i just know that um acid rain apparently is a big problem in Canada from what comes over the border from us
sw3887B-ms98-a-0008 43.250250 66.748000 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0009 66.748000 68.222375 yeah
sw3887B-ms98-a-0010 68.222375 78.614750 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0011 78.614750 85.915625 yeah the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes um i guess there's been a lot of pressure to um
sw3887B-ms98-a-0012 85.915625 91.376250 do away with the CFCs in these spray bottles which has been a real problem
sw3887B-ms98-a-0013 91.376250 93.724500 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0014 93.724500 104.108000 [noise] again i that's what i hear and and there's this big debate apparently about whether the ozone there's a hole in the ozone or not but at last i heard it was
sw3887B-ms98-a-0015 104.108000 108.839875 uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
sw3887B-ms98-a-0016 108.839875 109.892875 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0017 109.892875 113.718000 well it is scary and i think it will uh
sw3887B-ms98-a-0018 113.718000 119.210250 continue to force us to clean up our act literally and figuratively
sw3887B-ms98-a-0019 119.210250 123.067500 we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment
sw3887B-ms98-a-0020 123.067500 132.354750 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0021 132.354750 144.581500 [noise] i- i i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't do that [noise] in Los Angeles they're apparently going to they've passed laws that for habit for example people using uh 
sw3887B-ms98-a-0022 144.581500 149.156875 [noise] barbecues gasoline lawn mowers
sw3887B-ms98-a-0023 149.156875 160.603625 um and it's really bad in places like Los Angeles and it's gotten bad in Denver and and uh it's not too bad around here although you see it you know more and more in the sky
sw3887B-ms98-a-0024 160.603625 170.241500 and people in this country are really wedded to their uh cars and our economy seems to and this i think is one of the big problems
sw3887B-ms98-a-0025 170.241500 172.735750 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0026 172.735750 174.600125 yeah
sw3887B-ms98-a-0027 174.600125 196.469875 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0028 196.469875 197.940875 yeah
sw3887B-ms98-a-0029 197.940875 205.310000 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0030 205.310000 210.314375 well that makes a lot of sense i mean i- i hadn't thought about it that way but it it
sw3887B-ms98-a-0031 210.314375 211.341125 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0032 211.341125 212.813375 yeah
sw3887B-ms98-a-0033 212.813375 220.604625 [silence]
sw3887B-ms98-a-0034 220.604625 227.795875 [noise] no and i think yeah and i think that that more and more it's becoming apparent to people that the earth
sw3887B-ms98-a-0035 227.795875 235.955500 which includes all the people on it and everything that's going on it is a is an organism of sorts and that there is a [noise] uh a whole 
sw3887B-ms98-a-0036 235.955500 249.930125 set of organic relationships that if we start to destroy one part of it it's going to tell us about it and uh we're going to feel it and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a
sw3887B-ms98-a-0037 249.930125 252.576125 big structural change in the economy
sw3887B-ms98-a-0038 252.576125 267.319250 uh in this country uh whether people are willing to get out of their cars and i[n]- in this country uh the the solution that that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable for example taxing people heavily for using their cars
sw3887B-ms98-a-0039 267.319250 275.402500 and uh i'm i have a little sports car that i enjoy using and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive but
sw3887B-ms98-a-0040 275.402500 281.136375 i think uh we're gonna have to make some fundamental changes and and i'm i'm not sure
sw3887B-ms98-a-0041 281.136375 286.831250 how long it's gonna take or what it's gonna take because they keep saying that the economy
sw3887B-ms98-a-0042 286.831250 290.964250 is gonna depend on how many cars and houses we sell
sw3887B-ms98-a-0043 290.964250 297.762000 [silence]
