sw3823B-ms98-a-0002 0.317500 2.729875 so have you remodeled your house recently
sw3823B-ms98-a-0003 2.729875 12.681250 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0004 12.681250 15.475125 can you do that yourself or do you have it done
sw3823B-ms98-a-0005 15.475125 22.301500 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0006 22.301500 24.926375 and then you put putty around the edges
sw3823B-ms98-a-0007 24.926375 26.147250 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0008 26.147250 28.506875 i'm i'm impressed that you did that though
sw3823B-ms98-a-0009 28.506875 29.374875 [laughter]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0010 29.374875 32.604500 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0011 32.604500 44.697375 we um live in our current house about three years and we've only done minor repairs like painting and we did put a new roof on but previously we had owned a eighty year old house in another city
sw3823B-ms98-a-0012 44.697375 50.772500 and that's where i got my real experience at repairs and so i've replaced many windows [laughter]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0013 50.772500 60.466750 but they had wooden they were wooden windows and um i don't know for some reason it the putty seemed easier or something because_1 it blended in
sw3823B-ms98-a-0014 60.466750 64.691000 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0015 64.691000 78.169500 well uh we had a lot of it done i can't claim to have done much of it it had wood floors that we had refinished commercially so that they were all um even t[iled]- what do y[ou]- i forgot what you call that where you [laughter] skim the top and then revarnish
sw3823B-ms98-a-0016 78.169500 82.869625 and we had it had real plaster walls so we had a lot of plasterwork done
sw3823B-ms98-a-0017 82.869625 97.054750 we bought when we bought the house uh most of the walls were covered in fabric and although it was sort of pretty when we went through it once that the previous owners had their furniture out it looked pretty bad so whe[n]- then we took down the
sw3823B-ms98-a-0018 97.054750 101.877625 um fabric to find huge plaster cracks
sw3823B-ms98-a-0019 101.877625 111.426750 not unexpected i suppose but so we repaired a lot of that and then um we didn't do any real major we moved just a couple walls
sw3823B-ms98-a-0020 111.426750 122.788125 and we put in new bathroom fixture n[ot]- no[t]- we kept the fixtures but we put in like a new we did put in a new bathtub and then we sort of bought the antique looking
sw3823B-ms98-a-0021 122.788125 126.447500 you know the brass plumbing type thing although it was new
sw3823B-ms98-a-0022 126.447500 132.807625 i like old houses but it is everyone talks about it it's true small bathrooms and small closets
sw3823B-ms98-a-0023 132.807625 140.019000 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0024 140.019000 141.367750 uh-huh
sw3823B-ms98-a-0025 141.367750 144.326000 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0026 144.326000 148.203125 and plumbing you have to know a lot about plumbing [laughter]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0027 148.203125 150.314375 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0028 150.314375 151.790500 that's right
sw3823B-ms98-a-0029 151.790500 157.947250 you know we had we ran into an interesting complication um our house it had fifty six windows
sw3823B-ms98-a-0030 157.947250 172.197125 so we decided in or[der]- with an exorbitant heat bill we decided one way we would attack that we put storm windows on and then we put insulation in the attic a a lot of it because we didn't have very much the problem and we never anticipated it was in the summertime
sw3823B-ms98-a-0031 172.197125 185.556875 the humidity it it would rise and in the stairwell at the top of the stairwell it literally would um the humidity would condense on the walls so that the walls would sort of sweat and
sw3823B-ms98-a-0032 185.556875 191.835875 when we had an engineer come out and talk he just said that we had over insulated our house so it quote couldn't breath [laughter]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0033 191.835875 199.989250 and so the humidity when it would you know that the the highest point would go up there and then and then would condense and it was it was really a problem 
sw3823B-ms98-a-0034 199.989250 201.390125 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0035 201.390125 209.639125 [noise] well not you could i don't know i'm sure over the long term it would and it would kind of cause sort of streaky pattern in the in the paint
sw3823B-ms98-a-0036 209.639125 220.459750 um we put in the first thing we tried we just put in a fan in that area so that we could circulate the air and hope that that would help um
sw3823B-ms98-a-0037 220.459750 232.530250 we actually took a screen uh door window off one of windows [laughter] to try and allow a little ventilation in that area and then the truth is it then became
sw3823B-ms98-a-0038 232.530250 245.982250 cooler weather and then we sold our [laughter-house] [laughter] and i never i always hope that the owners didn't have the same problem next year it's all those things that you don't necessarily want to tell them i don't know i mean we weren't trying to be dishonest or anything you just 
sw3823B-ms98-a-0039 245.982250 254.964250 we gave it our best shot but it was kind of ironic that we thought we were being so energy conscious and you know it's
sw3823B-ms98-a-0040 254.964250 257.395625 perhaps we overdid it
sw3823B-ms98-a-0041 257.395625 260.279250 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0042 260.279250 266.841250 its prettiest features it had beautiful wood molding high ceilings and it had beautiful cut glass french doors
sw3823B-ms98-a-0043 266.841250 273.308750 and um i suppose that was it's it's prettiest features b[ut]- and the and the floors were beautiful
sw3823B-ms98-a-0044 273.308750 278.051500 but it much like the Swiss Avenue area in Dallas
sw3823B-ms98-a-0045 278.051500 280.990625 i don't i only have friends there
sw3823B-ms98-a-0046 280.990625 287.223875 i don't think i have the energy or the money [laughter] for those sort of beautiful old homes now
sw3823B-ms98-a-0047 287.223875 294.495750 [silence]
sw3823B-ms98-a-0048 294.495750 295.630750 that's
sw3823B-ms98-a-0049 295.630750 299.074000 [silence]
