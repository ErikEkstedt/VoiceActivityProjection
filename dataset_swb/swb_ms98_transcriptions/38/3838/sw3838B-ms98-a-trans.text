sw3838B-ms98-a-0035 168.612750 181.474375 um yes which i was always amazed i have one of them_1 um but uh you know to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that it's a tremendous amount of work
sw3838B-ms98-a-0036 181.474375 192.142000 [silence]
sw3838B-ms98-a-0037 192.142000 198.176000 have you think children you can um use crafts to make wonderful things for children
sw3838B-ms98-a-0038 198.176000 204.125750 i think when babies i think afghans and and the crocheted little sweaters and
sw3838B-ms98-a-0039 204.125750 211.151625 are are wonderful and and they'll wear them_1 [laughter] once they get old enough to talk then they no longer will wear [laughter-your]

sw3838B-ms98-a-0041 243.646375 255.206000 oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for Christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful Christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely 
sw3838B-ms98-a-0042 255.206000 264.754750 but when i washed them although i took the precaution of turning them inside out i really didn't do anything else and truly everything fell off or most of it so i ha[d]- i went and bought just some
sw3838B-ms98-a-0043 264.754750 272.213750 cloth glue and glued it all back and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges and and it was [laughter-salvageable] and i
sw3838B-ms98-a-0044 272.213750 278.965125 but it's so i'm familiar with that but i think you're very clever to um sew around the edges i think gluing alone
sw3838B-ms98-a-0045 278.965125 284.011500 certainly would if you wash it any amount of time it tends to kind of come loose at the edges 
sw3838B-ms98-a-0046 284.011500 298.306000 [silence]
