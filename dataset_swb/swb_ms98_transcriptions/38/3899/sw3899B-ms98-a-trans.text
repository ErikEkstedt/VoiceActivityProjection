sw3899B-ms98-a-0005 7.030625 16.618125 well um i worry about incineration you know i worry that we're we're doing way too much of that although i'm not sure
sw3899B-ms98-a-0006 16.618125 23.488000 the one thing that i have trouble with is wood smoke whe[ther]- how whether that's a very serious one or not um
sw3899B-ms98-a-0007 23.488000 25.736250 you know uh with

sw3899B-ms98-a-0010 47.136000 54.039125 stuff in it you know the spray bottles and i uh try to do everything i can but that's the one thing that i think is
sw3899B-ms98-a-0011 54.039125 58.966250 very difficult is is uh wood fires because it seems to me that they were natural
sw3899B-ms98-a-0012 58.966250 65.093375 that's a that's a natural process and unlike unlike you know all of the rest of it but

sw3899B-ms98-a-0014 65.857375 70.589500 [silence]
sw3899B-ms98-a-0015 70.589500 82.522125 that that that's what they have yeah [noise] but um i you know i- i am really concerned about it because you can you're beginning t[o]- well you're beginning to see the air
sw3899B-ms98-a-0016 82.522125 92.476375 and [noise] and that's frightening and i know in California uh a whole lot is being done i don't know how well that's working and if all those things all those laws went through
sw3899B-ms98-a-0017 92.476375 97.925125 about about the for the car manufacturers and everything an[d]- has that do you know

sw3899B-ms98-a-0021 104.528500 117.321250 but i think what they're gonna do is try to get the try to get the car manufacturers to make cars that you know use gasoline m[ore]- m[ore]- uh better and and more cleanly or use cleaner fuel
sw3899B-ms98-a-0022 117.321250 119.531250 [silence]
