sw3818B-ms98-a-0024 102.614750 114.928375 for the last three weeks he's turned us into the police and in to the uh the animal control and every time they come over of course he's very well behaved and he doesn't bark or anything and so
sw3818B-ms98-a-0025 114.928375 124.515250 it's just really gotten out of hand i mean he has called and threatened my kids and to come over and [laughter-kill] the dog it's go[ing]- it's just berserk
sw3818B-ms98-a-0026 124.515250 134.755625 he does [noise] he has a dog himself out in the backyard that barks but for some reason this dog's bark just drives him up a wall and he's just
