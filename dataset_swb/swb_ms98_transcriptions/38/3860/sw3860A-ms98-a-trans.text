sw3860A-ms98-a-0002 4.579750 10.517625 well it's a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because
sw3860A-ms98-a-0003 10.517625 21.651250 um i don't have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but there's plenty of other siblings to help out
sw3860A-ms98-a-0004 21.651250 35.670000 however on my husband's side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how we're going to make ends meet once they're gone
sw3860A-ms98-a-0005 35.670000 36.969750 um
sw3860A-ms98-a-0006 36.969750 49.738875 you know my mother-in-law constantly says things like w[ell]- you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish we'd all go like in a car [laughter-accident] so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh
sw3860A-ms98-a-0007 49.738875 52.500250 um it's a scary issue i think

sw3860A-ms98-a-0022 131.512250 139.428000 [silence]
sw3860A-ms98-a-0023 139.428000 141.294125 yes i know
sw3860A-ms98-a-0024 141.294125 142.508375 one
sw3860A-ms98-a-0025 142.508375 144.986500 [silence]
sw3860A-ms98-a-0026 144.986500 154.864000 um i think that's kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care
sw3860A-ms98-a-0027 154.864000 159.223000 um my husband's grandmother is in a nursing home and
sw3860A-ms98-a-0028 159.223000 167.518500 i don't think they've termed what she has as Alzheimer's but it you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood 
sw3860A-ms98-a-0029 167.518500 178.379500 and she doesn't know who you are often ti[mes]- often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns
sw3860A-ms98-a-0030 178.379500 187.719500 you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she [laughter-doesn't] know who you are but
sw3860A-ms98-a-0031 187.719500 197.469125 [laughter-the] home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together
sw3860A-ms98-a-0032 197.469125 200.180125 and so her roommate um
sw3860A-ms98-a-0033 200.180125 213.133000 is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i don't know about that type of situation where
sw3860A-ms98-a-0034 213.133000 220.808625 you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um it's a Methodist home
sw3860A-ms98-a-0035 220.808625 225.112125 um for the elderly [noise] and uh
sw3860A-ms98-a-0036 225.112125 232.473875 they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home
sw3860A-ms98-a-0037 232.473875 237.008125 you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need
sw3860A-ms98-a-0038 237.008125 243.284125 you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those
sw3860A-ms98-a-0039 243.284125 244.926750 um
sw3860A-ms98-a-0040 244.926750 246.569500 that's about
