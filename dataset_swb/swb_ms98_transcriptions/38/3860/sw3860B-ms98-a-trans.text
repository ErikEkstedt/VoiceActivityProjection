sw3860B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.925250 had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home
sw3860B-ms98-a-0002 4.925250 35.267875 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0003 35.267875 36.352750 uh-huh
sw3860B-ms98-a-0004 36.352750 48.476375 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0005 48.476375 49.552500 yeah
sw3860B-ms98-a-0006 49.552500 52.697375 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0007 52.697375 56.739625 well i've been very fortunate uh my father
sw3860B-ms98-a-0008 56.739625 62.463875 uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years
sw3860B-ms98-a-0009 62.463875 71.187500 and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years
sw3860B-ms98-a-0010 71.187500 73.646500 deciding where he wanted to be
sw3860B-ms98-a-0011 73.646500 77.794375 and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm
sw3860B-ms98-a-0012 77.794375 82.583875 and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia
sw3860B-ms98-a-0013 82.583875 85.850625 and uh moved in there
sw3860B-ms98-a-0014 85.850625 100.163500 and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it
sw3860B-ms98-a-0015 100.163500 113.611000 and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August
sw3860B-ms98-a-0016 113.611000 116.069875 and he died in September
sw3860B-ms98-a-0017 116.069875 120.586375 just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday
sw3860B-ms98-a-0018 120.586375 124.710125 and uh it was fortunate that uh
sw3860B-ms98-a-0019 124.710125 131.539750 uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimer's disease
sw3860B-ms98-a-0020 131.539750 135.705750 and her mental faculties were going very rapidly
sw3860B-ms98-a-0021 135.705750 140.297125 and that's that's uh something that's very stressful to handle 
sw3860B-ms98-a-0022 140.297125 144.485875 so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot
sw3860B-ms98-a-0023 144.485875 178.248500 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0024 178.248500 179.407375 uh-huh
sw3860B-ms98-a-0025 179.407375 196.976750 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0026 196.976750 197.988250 uh-huh
sw3860B-ms98-a-0027 197.988250 229.425500 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0028 229.425500 230.467625 uh-huh
sw3860B-ms98-a-0029 230.467625 246.558500 [silence]
sw3860B-ms98-a-0030 246.558500 253.239625 yeah my uh i have uh an aunt who's in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina
sw3860B-ms98-a-0031 253.239625 266.706500 and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in
sw3860B-ms98-a-0032 266.706500 279.121875 and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that
sw3860B-ms98-a-0033 279.121875 282.657125 and uh she moved in it was only about
sw3860B-ms98-a-0034 282.657125 292.693375 oh it's walking distance to where she lived [laughter] so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals 
sw3860B-ms98-a-0035 292.693375 298.304250 um it's kind of amazing the disparity that exists between
sw3860B-ms98-a-0036 298.304250 298.946000 so[me]-
