sw3893A-ms98-a-0028 116.504875 119.767500 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0029 119.767500 126.287875 that's not bad considering you did it yourself although i'm sure it was a real pain to have to live you know with everything
sw3893A-ms98-a-0030 126.287875 136.453750 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0031 136.453750 137.980250 um-hum

sw3893A-ms98-a-0036 156.324750 161.088375 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0037 161.088375 170.480875 no i know what you mean [laughter] sounds to me like the perfect excuse that your wife didn't cook for about three months [laughter]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0038 170.480875 174.300750 [laughter] did you have any major catastrophes or anything
sw3893A-ms98-a-0039 174.300750 177.633000 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0040 177.633000 179.102125 uh-huh
sw3893A-ms98-a-0041 179.102125 180.926625 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0042 180.926625 183.407625 [laughter]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0043 183.407625 186.799125 [noise] well that's quite an undertaking uh you know
sw3893A-ms98-a-0044 186.799125 188.544250 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0045 188.544250 199.071875 well nothing that big a deal my husband did um he made a cedar closet and shelving out in the garage uh for us which really was nice um
sw3893A-ms98-a-0046 199.071875 203.789750 i don't know how it is in Biloxi we Dallas has no basements i suspect Biloxi [noise]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0047 203.789750 209.859875 yeah well we come from the Midwest where there's basements and you know so you have to make storage where you can
sw3893A-ms98-a-0048 209.859875 220.694625 and uh he bought the sheeting uh the cedar sheeting and put that in and i didn't know for certain how that would you know how that would work out if it would be tight enough to keep the bugs and all out but
sw3893A-ms98-a-0049 220.694625 233.695625 it's been great we haven't had any problems with moths or anything and the extra he finished the outside painted it to match the uh garage walls which is white and it's just beautiful it really added a whole lot you know {storagewise} to the house
sw3893A-ms98-a-0050 233.695625 235.086500 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0051 235.086500 243.577625 but uh i think the only glitches he ran into on that i put a few nails in it so i consider myself a partner in this [laughter] but
sw3893A-ms98-a-0052 243.577625 256.230750 yeah right the only thing we had to do is down at the bottom of the doors he had to put in oh like some extra closure because even though he thought that the um the plywood that he got was straight
sw3893A-ms98-a-0053 256.230750 264.060750 somehow the humidity or something warped it a little bit while he was building it and we have to have a little closing you know to hold it down at the bottom
sw3893A-ms98-a-0054 264.060750 266.041625 [noise] um-hum
sw3893A-ms98-a-0055 266.041625 273.585875 but th[at]- that was about it but our house in only four years old so we haven't done you know just a whole lot to it at this point
sw3893A-ms98-a-0056 273.585875 274.594125 [silence]
sw3893A-ms98-a-0057 274.594125 286.486000 um-hum although we're talking about adding uh the the ceilings here are high and the pitch of the uh roofs are very high and we're talking about adding like some rooms up in the attic space
sw3893A-ms98-a-0058 286.486000 289.539000 uh because there is so much space up there
sw3893A-ms98-a-0059 289.539000 296.334250 but uh i don't know that that's something we will undertake ourselves part of it we'll probably do you know like hanging the
sw3893A-ms98-a-0060 296.334250 297.922000 [silence]
