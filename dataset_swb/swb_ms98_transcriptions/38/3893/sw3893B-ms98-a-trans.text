sw3893B-ms98-a-0002 1.721875 9.772375 well as about as a matter of fact about two years ago right now uh i've completely and totally remodeled and restored my kitchen
sw3893B-ms98-a-0003 9.772375 20.546375 yeah i uh i tore out the uh walls all the way down to the studs and started over we had had a uh the kitchen we've we had was um
sw3893B-ms98-a-0004 20.546375 29.438625 had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops
sw3893B-ms98-a-0005 29.438625 34.266750 at first i wa[s]- we were just gonna paint the thing and you know how everything just sort of grows
sw3893B-ms98-a-0006 34.266750 47.265875 and uh so i ended up just just t[earing]- tearing out the whole place and uh putting sheet rock in and building my own cabinets with ceramic tile on the counter tops and just everything [laughter] new floor [laughter]
sw3893B-ms98-a-0007 47.265875 53.764500 well uh i'm fairly good at it not not not enough to be professional or anything but i can do my own
sw3893B-ms98-a-0008 53.764500 55.039750 [silence]
sw3893B-ms98-a-0009 55.039750 56.577000 yeah um-hum
sw3893B-ms98-a-0010 56.577000 61.111000 i love that it's it's really pretty we had just uh Formica
sw3893B-ms98-a-0011 61.111000 68.084375 and when i built the new cabinets uh i looked into this tile deal and i thought well you know i think we can probably do this
sw3893B-ms98-a-0012 68.084375 71.214250 and um it was uh
sw3893B-ms98-a-0013 71.214250 82.767125 it was not e[ven]- not hard at all um it just i just followed the instructions the basic instructions that you use with the tile and uh they're not hard at all really it's just about anybody can do that
sw3893B-ms98-a-0014 82.767125 86.055375 [silence]
sw3893B-ms98-a-0015 86.055375 97.496500 no not at all um uh what we what i've been doing is just using some like bleach and it uh gets it clean but it does it has browned over the the couple of years
sw3893B-ms98-a-0016 97.496500 106.132500 you know but it really don't look that bad even though it has gotten brown you know what i should have done now that i think about it was used brown colored grout
sw3893B-ms98-a-0017 106.132500 107.400125 and
sw3893B-ms98-a-0018 107.400125 109.387125 that's right that's right
sw3893B-ms98-a-0019 109.387125 114.300000 you know because it does stain some i mean you could whiten it but i never have [laughter]

sw3893B-ms98-a-0025 125.071500 133.418500 well it was for a while the worst part about it was we had to do it when i got to the sink part over here what i did was i left this cabinet
sw3893B-ms98-a-0026 133.418500 137.460625 just about this one wall where the sink is to the very last
sw3893B-ms98-a-0027 137.460625 146.037125 and um i figured well you know i'll remodel the rest of the kitchen and then when we get to that point i'll do that last because_1 we so we can keep the sink as long as possible
sw3893B-ms98-a-0028 146.037125 150.360750 and then we had we were without a sink about a week or a week and a half or so
sw3893B-ms98-a-0029 150.360750 155.467000 and um what we had to do was just take the dishes and uh put them_1 in a big dish pan
sw3893B-ms98-a-0030 155.467000 165.757125 and you get water from the bath tub and then rinse them_1 in you know for with the bath wa[ter]- not not in the tub [laughter] but you're just letting it run under there you know [laughter]
