sw3889B-ms98-a-0004 8.964000 12.139375 but it wasn't um it was clothing
sw3889B-ms98-a-0005 12.139375 14.349500 and um
sw3889B-ms98-a-0006 14.349500 23.916125 the blouse was uh supposed to be a size six but the shoulder drooped over my [laughter-shoulder] and it wasn't you know the style of the blouse it just
sw3889B-ms98-a-0007 23.916125 33.646000 i think it was sized wrong but you know it was a nice blouse but and um i took some uh lingerie back that wasn't
sw3889B-ms98-a-0008 33.646000 42.496625 well i the size that i usually buy did not fit in their in their brand it was too small
sw3889B-ms98-a-0009 42.496625 50.125375 uh but as far as large items go like appliances or things like that no
sw3889B-ms98-a-0010 50.125375 72.911125 [silence]
sw3889B-ms98-a-0011 72.911125 74.259000 uh-huh
sw3889B-ms98-a-0012 74.259000 78.840500 [silence]
sw3889B-ms98-a-0013 78.840500 80.553750 um um-hum
sw3889B-ms98-a-0014 80.553750 90.708750 [silence]
sw3889B-ms98-a-0015 90.708750 94.914125 well uh i would like to comment on my washer um
sw3889B-ms98-a-0016 94.914125 100.781375 um my washer if it gets out of balance it makes a horrible noise
sw3889B-ms98-a-0017 100.781375 104.415000 and you have to make sure that your clothes are balanced
sw3889B-ms98-a-0018 104.415000 118.058625 but um it was doing it quite frequently and so i had a repairman come out and look at it and he said well you need this and so done to this machine and i said oh really
sw3889B-ms98-a-0019 118.058625 128.831750 and i he says let me show you and i sai[d]- i said oh yeah i see that it really needs something bad you know but it didn't uh have an affect on the performance of the machine
sw3889B-ms98-a-0020 128.831750 134.642875 what what it was the um it was a cap after your um
sw3889B-ms98-a-0021 134.642875 140.809125 after the body of the machine was in place it was under that so it wasn't visible
sw3889B-ms98-a-0022 140.809125 142.724000 and it was out of sight
sw3889B-ms98-a-0023 142.724000 144.568000 and it was rusting out
sw3889B-ms98-a-0024 144.568000 150.837375 although i don't have any rust in my clothes and i said okay how much do you want to
sw3889B-ms98-a-0025 150.837375 159.921875 uh do this repair work and he told me almost two hundred and fifty dollars and i said hey i can go buy a new one for that price
sw3889B-ms98-a-0026 159.921875 166.668125 and i s[aid]- and i said no i'm not gonna do that i said the performance of the machine is not affected by that part
sw3889B-ms98-a-0027 166.668125 174.468500 and i said and that's not that's not the cause of the imbalance i said i just have to be more careful how i put my clothes in
sw3889B-ms98-a-0028 174.468500 180.091000 and um so that was two years ago and my machine is still functioning fine
sw3889B-ms98-a-0029 180.091000 181.239125 [laughter]
sw3889B-ms98-a-0030 181.239125 192.013875 so i didn't you know and he wanted thirty five dollars for a service call and i says hey wait a minute they didn't tell me that when i called and i said i'm not paying it
sw3889B-ms98-a-0031 192.013875 199.738000 i says if they had told me up front i would have paid it but since they did not say ma'am there's a thirty five dollar service call
sw3889B-ms98-a-0032 199.738000 211.188375 but they didn't and i says i refuse to pay it and so he he had called his office and told them what i said and i- i was released from that service charge
sw3889B-ms98-a-0033 211.188375 225.586000 so you know they were they to me that was underhanded i wouldn't have minded if they had said okay uh we have that service is thirty five dollars or whatever they they charge maybe it's different um
sw3889B-ms98-a-0034 225.586000 234.140375 uh charges for different things i don't know but it seems to me a service call would be kind of universal for anything
sw3889B-ms98-a-0035 234.140375 240.037500 and then they get into the nitty gritties of charges for whatever you've got wrong with your
sw3889B-ms98-a-0036 240.037500 241.508250 you write them_1
