sw3872A-ms98-a-0015 51.356250 63.719000 but he was here a year ago and uh he was involved in wr[estling]- wrestling and along with my three older sons we had six children and our oldest son our second son is uh

sw3872A-ms98-a-0021 110.746375 119.913625 the parents today an[d]- a[nd]- and there is so much involvement that it gets pretty difficult but i think with with church and everything else that you're doing
