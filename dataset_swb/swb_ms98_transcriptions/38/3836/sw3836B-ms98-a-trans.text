sw3836B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.486250 [noise]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0002 0.486250 11.268250 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0003 11.268250 19.352750 well i haven't heard any of the specific details of uh what they have planned but uh
sw3836B-ms98-a-0004 19.352750 33.193750 basically the noise around Washington is that uh they're concerned that uh there's not enough health care insurance provided that uh very few families have uh health care insurance or
sw3836B-ms98-a-0005 33.193750 36.708250 any kind of uh coverage where they're employed
sw3836B-ms98-a-0006 36.708250 42.290250 uh i'm not sure that there's any real plan afoot
sw3836B-ms98-a-0007 42.290250 51.352750 to uh bring a health care plan on line that requires everybody to kick in like uh Social Security
sw3836B-ms98-a-0008 51.352750 57.599125 but uh one of the plan that's been circulated about is a requirement
sw3836B-ms98-a-0009 57.599125 70.243875 that employers provide uh health care insurance for their employees and kick in something like eighty percent of the cost of that insurance
sw3836B-ms98-a-0010 70.243875 80.039875 and uh if they don't do that then they have to pay into a federal fund that provides the uh health care insurance
sw3836B-ms98-a-0011 80.039875 83.592000 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0012 83.592000 85.239625 yeah
sw3836B-ms98-a-0013 85.239625 86.767000 uh-huh
sw3836B-ms98-a-0014 86.767000 87.773750 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0015 87.773750 96.512500 i tell you one thing that uh we were discussing this evening here that uh discourages me a little bit and worries me about the health care system 
sw3836B-ms98-a-0016 96.512500 104.152250 uh i know that certainly in this region uh that the number of students graduating from dental school has been quite large
sw3836B-ms98-a-0017 104.152250 109.997500 and a lot of the foreign students that uh came and stayed in this country didn't go back home
sw3836B-ms98-a-0018 109.997500 119.183500 so there's been a kind of dentists are kind of glut on the market and they're uh having a lot of trouble competing and making ends meet 
sw3836B-ms98-a-0019 119.183500 128.687750 and uh physicians i think may be facing the same situation except they apparently have a very strong
sw3836B-ms98-a-0020 128.687750 134.555375 organization and they are actually preventing students from entering medical college
sw3836B-ms98-a-0021 134.555375 139.780375 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0022 139.780375 141.042125 yeah
sw3836B-ms98-a-0023 141.042125 143.570125 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0024 143.570125 144.912250 uh-huh
sw3836B-ms98-a-0025 144.912250 158.920875 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0026 158.920875 160.213625 yeah
sw3836B-ms98-a-0027 160.213625 171.282750 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0028 171.282750 172.542000 yeah
sw3836B-ms98-a-0029 172.542000 178.729125 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0030 178.729125 180.118375 uh-huh
sw3836B-ms98-a-0031 180.118375 200.414750 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0032 200.414750 212.221250 well i think that's sort of happened universally to all our industries i think our light plane industry went out of business because the uh cost of uh manufacturers' product liability was too high
sw3836B-ms98-a-0033 212.221250 223.375875 uh but i think on the other side of the coin that uh maybe the AMA is being a little bit too protective of some of their physicians uh
sw3836B-ms98-a-0034 223.375875 224.850000 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0035 224.850000 234.329875 yeah i've i've got my own set of war stories uh my daughter uh turns out she's allergic to gnats
sw3836B-ms98-a-0036 234.329875 239.405625 and the first time i went in to have it treated it cost two thousand five hundred dollars
sw3836B-ms98-a-0037 239.405625 248.962875 and the second time i went to a different doctor and the doctor said oh she's allergic to gnats give her some Benadryl that was a two dollar and forty five cent treatment for it
sw3836B-ms98-a-0038 248.962875 250.058375 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0039 250.058375 260.536125 and so uh you know four days in the hospital the children's ward on IV penicillin uh was a lot less effective than a couple of teaspoons full of Benadryl
sw3836B-ms98-a-0040 260.536125 267.108250 and i have other friends that uh have really been misdiagnosed
sw3836B-ms98-a-0041 267.108250 273.932250 and i think it's probably a shame that there isn't more competition among doctors and there isn't a little more policing
sw3836B-ms98-a-0042 273.932250 276.686625 uh of the results
sw3836B-ms98-a-0043 276.686625 283.725375 [silence]
sw3836B-ms98-a-0044 283.725375 284.988250 yeah
sw3836B-ms98-a-0045 284.988250 300.098000 [silence]
