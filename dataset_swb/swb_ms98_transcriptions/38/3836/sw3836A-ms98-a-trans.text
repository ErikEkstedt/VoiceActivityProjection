sw3836A-ms98-a-0003 2.701750 4.402625 [silence]
sw3836A-ms98-a-0004 4.402625 11.941125 have you heard anything in particular about the universal health care sys[tem]- uh health insurance program that they're talking about
sw3836A-ms98-a-0005 11.941125 36.652750 [silence]
sw3836A-ms98-a-0006 36.652750 38.043875 yeah

sw3836A-ms98-a-0012 79.545000 86.388000 and it'd probably be cheaper to go ahead and pay a percentage of the local plan
sw3836A-ms98-a-0013 86.388000 90.132375 yeah especially for major corporations
sw3836A-ms98-a-0014 90.132375 103.541500 [silence]
sw3836A-ms98-a-0015 103.541500 104.905750 yeah

sw3836A-ms98-a-0020 120.689375 134.081750 [silence]
sw3836A-ms98-a-0021 134.081750 140.461375 oh yeah they keep uh the AMA you've got to go through the AMA to get accepted into medical school
sw3836A-ms98-a-0022 140.461375 144.493750 and they keep a tight rein on how many people get in
sw3836A-ms98-a-0023 144.493750 151.849125 but uh now dental school that's yeah if they've got a glut on the market of dentists um
sw3836A-ms98-a-0024 151.849125 159.375125 i i i don't mean to be ugly about it but uh costs of dental work are pretty high
sw3836A-ms98-a-0025 159.375125 171.970375 and if there's something i don't necessarily think it needs to be driven down again but to keep it from shooting up of course dentistry i don't think has near the problem with like malpractice insurance and such
sw3836A-ms98-a-0026 171.970375 179.801875 that's probably the worst thing about health care right now is the unlimited capacity for suing for malpractice and
sw3836A-ms98-a-0027 179.801875 187.435625 it seems to be the burden of proof that on the doctor that he didn't do something wrong rather than proving that he did
sw3836A-ms98-a-0028 187.435625 192.899750 and if he doesn't prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that he did everything just right
sw3836A-ms98-a-0029 192.899750 193.920250 [silence]
sw3836A-ms98-a-0030 193.920250 200.247500 then suddenly he's got you know two or three years wages down the toilet but uh

sw3836A-ms98-a-0053 278.829625 284.329500 from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion
sw3836A-ms98-a-0054 284.329500 293.284375 they're not feeling you know insulted they're it's like that's a little you know sweat off my brow simply because
sw3836A-ms98-a-0055 293.284375 300.098000 i mean you know th[ey're]- they're covering their own tail legally and you know a second opinion
