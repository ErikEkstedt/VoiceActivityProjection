sw3896B-ms98-a-0012 35.767125 44.914125 i try to get out and do a little bit of running during the week uh when the weather is good or it's a little tough in the winter when it gets dark so early but
sw3896B-ms98-a-0013 44.914125 49.657625 um uh i try to get out as much as i can
sw3896B-ms98-a-0014 49.657625 56.510625 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0015 56.510625 58.114625 yeah
sw3896B-ms98-a-0016 58.114625 59.871625 [laughter]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0017 59.871625 62.315250 sits there and collects dust huh
sw3896B-ms98-a-0018 62.315250 63.319375 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0019 63.319375 70.478875 uh i- i lived in Colorado quite a few years and i was more inspired to workout there just because the weather was
sw3896B-ms98-a-0020 70.478875 83.533000 uh clear more of the time and and i like to stay in better shape to go out and do a lot of skiing and things like that and since i moved to Dallas i guess i haven't been as inspired [laughter] to get out and do as much
sw3896B-ms98-a-0021 83.533000 88.927000 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0022 88.927000 90.328000 yeah
sw3896B-ms98-a-0023 90.328000 98.450125 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0024 98.450125 106.438875 yeah i- i find it kind of uh kind of a chore i guess to go uh uh on a regular
sw3896B-ms98-a-0025 106.438875 114.322125 schedule to work working out inside i'd much rather be outside either bicycling or or running or doing that type of thing
sw3896B-ms98-a-0026 114.322125 122.636125 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0027 122.636125 123.870250 uh-huh
sw3896B-ms98-a-0028 123.870250 127.887875 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0029 127.887875 130.744000 oh is it like a scenery or something
sw3896B-ms98-a-0030 130.744000 132.686750 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0031 132.686750 137.794750 yeah i guess you can put it in a higher gear if [laughter-you] [laughter-want] to pretend you're going up the hill 
sw3896B-ms98-a-0032 137.794750 141.621625 no i haven't but i- i have seen some things uh
sw3896B-ms98-a-0033 141.621625 147.509875 uh advertised in videos like that and i've heard some athletic clubs have
sw3896B-ms98-a-0034 147.509875 154.840625 uh have machines with a screen like that and that actually the computer
sw3896B-ms98-a-0035 154.840625 161.369500 uh whe[n]- when it shows you're going up a hill it actually makes the bike peddle harder and things like that
sw3896B-ms98-a-0036 161.369500 172.146375 and so it it uh trying to be a little bit realistic i guess they have the nice scenery like you know uh biking up some mountain road or [laughter-something] like that
sw3896B-ms98-a-0037 172.146375 178.890875 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0038 178.890875 191.887625 yeah we bought a uh stepper and uh in the winter time i've tired to use that uh a couple of times a week just because it's so hard to get outside and
sw3896B-ms98-a-0039 191.887625 200.934250 and and do much in the way of either y[ou]- like say fast walking or uh running i work downtown and it
sw3896B-ms98-a-0040 200.934250 208.569875 not as convenient to get out at lunchtime downtown Dallas although th[ere]- there is a Y very close i guess i could do that
sw3896B-ms98-a-0041 208.569875 220.944875 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0042 220.944875 224.394750 there they they do work you pretty good and
sw3896B-ms98-a-0043 224.394750 230.592625 um other things i've used that give you pretty good workout uh the rowing machines aren't to bad and
sw3896B-ms98-a-0044 230.592625 245.260625 one of the best ones although goo[d]- for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those Nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good
sw3896B-ms98-a-0045 245.260625 251.636500 balance i guess it's it it's better if you know how to cross country ski before you use those
sw3896B-ms98-a-0046 251.636500 257.936375 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0047 257.936375 269.622000 what's the i've i've heard some other people uh not too happy with President's uh they join and then it seems like that they don't have a lot of good things to say about it
sw3896B-ms98-a-0048 269.622000 285.792125 [silence]
sw3896B-ms98-a-0049 285.792125 287.581125 oh th[e]-
