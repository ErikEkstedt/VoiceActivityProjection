sw3846B-ms98-a-0002 0.307375 5.119500 i assume most of the books you're reading these days since you're a student have to do with studies
sw3846B-ms98-a-0003 5.119500 13.058250 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0004 13.058250 14.837250 the uh
sw3846B-ms98-a-0005 14.837250 18.154125 what year are you in in computer science
sw3846B-ms98-a-0006 18.154125 21.139375 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0007 21.139375 24.704375 yeah and so the course work you're doing is what
sw3846B-ms98-a-0008 24.704375 36.957875 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0009 36.957875 39.910750 i thought you said computer science was your major
sw3846B-ms98-a-0010 39.910750 42.564125 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0011 42.564125 45.561625 oh computer engineering okay that's yeah okay
sw3846B-ms98-a-0012 45.561625 47.086750 well
sw3846B-ms98-a-0013 47.086750 58.153625 no no i actually i'm an engineer by training and uh i it is my impression that's easier for an engineer to learn about computers than it is for a computer science person [laughter-to] [laughter-learn] [laughter-about] [laughter-computers]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0014 58.153625 59.275750 yeah
sw3846B-ms98-a-0015 59.275750 62.442500 [silence]

sw3846B-ms98-a-0018 66.039500 69.346250 right so who's books do you use for programming
sw3846B-ms98-a-0019 69.346250 73.198375 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0020 73.198375 76.296750 well tell me what language we're taking these days
sw3846B-ms98-a-0021 76.296750 77.433000 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0022 77.433000 82.505125 taking C okay is that just standard C or C plus plus
sw3846B-ms98-a-0023 82.505125 87.701625 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0024 87.701625 89.368625 yes right um-hum

sw3846B-ms98-a-0026 91.855500 105.309625 well C plus plus is object oriented and there is uh quite a bit of difference and it qu[ite]- often ha[s]- you need a book up front to tell you about uh precompiling and that sort of thing and then it normally does a little shuffle up front
sw3846B-ms98-a-0027 105.309625 115.270375 and then runs on ANSI C or some other similar dialect of C so it does uh some preprocessing to begin with who's book do you use in Pascal
sw3846B-ms98-a-0028 115.270375 117.795375 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0029 117.795375 126.456625 well how we going to talk about books [laughter] [laughter-well] [laughter-maybe] we better switch to pleasure then uh what do you read for pleasure
sw3846B-ms98-a-0030 126.456625 129.589125 [silence]

sw3846B-ms98-a-0044 176.616500 183.699000 i have actually gone back and i[s]- is long enough that was the first science fiction book i ever read was I Robot
sw3846B-ms98-a-0045 183.699000 184.912500 and it
sw3846B-ms98-a-0046 184.912500 192.797750 and it was so good i went back and read it again because_1 Asimov knows how to string things together you [laughter-know]

sw3846B-ms98-a-0067 241.892625 243.277375 i uh
sw3846B-ms98-a-0068 243.277375 255.057375 started uh long enough ago that uh vacuum tubes were still in business when i was a young engineer you know [noise] so i had to continually upgrade my education and
sw3846B-ms98-a-0069 255.057375 261.980250 that was really good for me because that's what i'd like to do anyway i'd like to be a permanent [laughter-student] [laughter-you] [laughter-know] so uh 
sw3846B-ms98-a-0070 261.980250 265.584375 [silence]
sw3846B-ms98-a-0071 265.584375 269.942375 yeah so you knew what you wanted to do yeah yeah
