sw3846A-ms98-a-0008 24.508625 37.282500 well right now i'm taking a a uh my fourth semester of of electronics dealing mostly with uh uh MOSFET and JFET transistors
sw3846A-ms98-a-0009 37.282500 38.775375 and
sw3846A-ms98-a-0010 38.775375 43.093000 well okay they they're [vocalized-noise] are gonna uh computer engineering
sw3846A-ms98-a-0011 43.093000 44.240125 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0012 44.240125 48.781750 okay i am getting some programm[ing]- right right now i'm taking my first semester in in
sw3846A-ms98-a-0013 48.781750 57.562500 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0014 57.562500 66.690500 yeah yeah well with th[is]- well they classify it as computer engineering technology so i'm getting a fair amount of programming as well as electronics
sw3846A-ms98-a-0015 66.690500 69.167875 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0016 69.167875 73.768875 uh it depends on which language they're working with um
sw3846A-ms98-a-0017 73.768875 75.368125 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0018 75.368125 80.607875 right now i'm taking C i've got three semesters in Pascal behind me

sw3846A-ms98-a-0020 81.988125 88.628000 uh that we're working with what what they called standard uh ANSI C
sw3846A-ms98-a-0021 88.628000 93.675875 um i'm not real sure what the difference is gonna be between C and C
sw3846A-ms98-a-0022 93.675875 94.743000 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0023 94.743000 95.960250 yeah

sw3846A-ms98-a-0027 112.137875 114.775375 okay well what we're working with is
sw3846A-ms98-a-0028 114.775375 118.989875 uh i don't remember the author's name
sw3846A-ms98-a-0029 118.989875 122.753500 [laughter]

sw3846A-ms98-a-0031 126.014625 129.802375 used to be i read a good deal of uh science fiction
sw3846A-ms98-a-0032 129.802375 135.580750 um Asimov um Clark uh
sw3846A-ms98-a-0033 135.580750 137.929875 there's uh
sw3846A-ms98-a-0034 137.929875 142.541375 the big one was Asimov his he's his stuff was easiest to find
sw3846A-ms98-a-0035 142.541375 152.392500 what got me started in the first place was uh my brother-in-law gave me a set the uh um Foundation Trilogy
sw3846A-ms98-a-0036 152.392500 158.518375 back junior a year an[d]- a when i -[wa]s a i[n]- in junior high school he gave it to me
sw3846A-ms98-a-0037 158.518375 164.384750 oh yeah and he's come up with what [vocalized-noise] three more books
sw3846A-ms98-a-0038 164.384750 167.123375 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0039 167.123375 170.562500 uh parts of it i got three parts of it
sw3846A-ms98-a-0040 170.562500 172.193625 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0041 172.193625 177.670375 yeah yeah wait a minute matter of fact i did read i- i Robot
sw3846A-ms98-a-0042 177.670375 181.777875 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0043 181.777875 186.727000 I Robot yeah that's pretty light reading for science fiction those kind of things
sw3846A-ms98-a-0044 186.727000 190.283875 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0045 190.283875 195.196875 yes he doe[s]- well the uh Foundation Trilogy is directly connected to I Robot
sw3846A-ms98-a-0046 195.196875 198.695500 as a matter of fact his last book Foundation and Earth
sw3846A-ms98-a-0047 198.695500 202.138375 they made the finally made the connection
sw3846A-ms98-a-0048 202.138375 204.013500 that uh
sw3846A-ms98-a-0049 204.013500 208.739000 um leader robot whatever his i don't remember his name now
sw3846A-ms98-a-0050 208.739000 214.739875 anyway he's still going in the Foun[dation]- at the uh in Foundation and Earth they meet up with him
sw3846A-ms98-a-0051 214.739875 227.718500 he's on a base on the moon and somehow or another earth has been so utterly polluted with uh uh uh radioactive fallout that it's utterly in[habitable]- uninhabitable even though it's been several million years
sw3846A-ms98-a-0052 227.718500 231.036250 [vocalized-noise] uh several hundred thousand years anyway
sw3846A-ms98-a-0053 231.036250 233.999250 so i[t's]- it's [vocalized-noise] utterly uninhabitable 
sw3846A-ms98-a-0054 233.999250 239.918125 [silence]
sw3846A-ms98-a-0055 239.918125 241.039750 oh yeah

sw3846A-ms98-a-0062 259.361500 263.602500 yeah yeah well i- i got started on student [vocalized-noise] late
sw3846A-ms98-a-0063 263.602500 267.736625 i was thirty three when i started to college for the first time
sw3846A-ms98-a-0064 267.736625 271.946625 oh yeah yeah i'd i'd been an auto mechanic for twenty years
sw3846A-ms98-a-0065 271.946625 280.720875 started about twelve years old for my father but uh decided you know i- i had a pretty good idea that wasn't what i wanted to do any more
