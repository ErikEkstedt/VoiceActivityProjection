sw3849A-ms98-a-0014 42.061375 46.027625 a used Toyota um Corolla
sw3849A-ms98-a-0015 46.027625 58.451875 and we used that until we [vocalized-noise] until it's about run into the ground and then we um bought a used um Toyota Tercel i was still a student at the time and um so
sw3849A-ms98-a-0016 58.451875 61.537000 um you bought what we could afford
sw3849A-ms98-a-0017 61.537000 63.552000 and
sw3849A-ms98-a-0018 63.552000 64.803500 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0019 64.803500 71.103125 i think definitely um now we would also get a a larger car
sw3849A-ms98-a-0020 71.103125 74.325875 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0021 74.325875 75.553625 oh
sw3849A-ms98-a-0022 75.553625 77.055750 very well
sw3849A-ms98-a-0023 77.055750 78.165625 um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0024 78.165625 79.370000 it um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0025 79.370000 80.759875 [silence]

sw3849A-ms98-a-0028 86.465125 93.884375 uh yeah it was about a hundred and fifty thousand and it may have gone further but um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0029 93.884375 97.205625 it was very reliable th[ough]- for us though
sw3849A-ms98-a-0030 97.205625 98.558250 um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0031 98.558250 101.521375 [silence]

sw3849A-ms98-a-0033 102.899125 111.544750 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0034 111.544750 114.967750 oh that's to be expected i would think
sw3849A-ms98-a-0035 114.967750 121.952000 h[opefully]- hopefully it just doesn't [vocalized-noise] happen at a a bad time [laughter] i mean when you're far away from anything or something
sw3849A-ms98-a-0036 121.952000 130.278750 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0037 130.278750 132.274500 uh-huh did you buy it new

sw3849A-ms98-a-0040 136.831875 140.658125 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0041 140.658125 144.883750 i see but well sounds like it's been a good deal for you
sw3849A-ms98-a-0042 144.883750 146.280000 um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0043 146.280000 151.381000 another thing i may consider the main thing i look for in a car is reliability
sw3849A-ms98-a-0044 151.381000 152.636250 and
sw3849A-ms98-a-0045 152.636250 167.287250 um i just go by what my dad says he's a mechanic and i remember growing up and and but he's al[ways]- never wanted to spend a lot on a car because_1 i grew up in a fairly large family six kids and we just didn't have a lot of money to spend on cars
sw3849A-ms98-a-0046 167.287250 179.480500 so um i remember growing up and having like Ramblers and stuff like that and think they're the most unreliable cars that ever existed i mean ours broke down all the time luckily my dad was [vocalized-noise] mechanic and he could fix them_1 but i remember
sw3849A-ms98-a-0047 179.480500 187.483750 he s[aid]- he said he would never buy um a foreign car but then in nineteen eighty he bought a used Toyota Corolla
sw3849A-ms98-a-0048 187.483750 197.216625 and i mean didn't even spend very much money for it i don't think he spent more than five hundred dollars for it but he said it was the most reliable car he ever had purchased
sw3849A-ms98-a-0049 197.216625 201.658375 and he has bought nothing but Toyota Corolla since that time
sw3849A-ms98-a-0050 201.658375 203.700875 and so um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0051 203.700875 215.664000 but i don't know my feeling is that American cars to keep up at all are becoming more reliable also so i may consider buying um an American made car
sw3849A-ms98-a-0052 215.664000 218.851625 my next my next purchase
sw3849A-ms98-a-0053 218.851625 232.089500 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0054 232.089500 233.813625 that's true
sw3849A-ms98-a-0055 233.813625 237.283625 i have a cou[sin]- yeah one of my cousins
sw3849A-ms98-a-0056 237.283625 240.378250 is trying to tell convince me that um
sw3849A-ms98-a-0057 240.378250 244.280875 the American made cars are becoming reli[able]- reliable but
sw3849A-ms98-a-0058 244.280875 251.836375 uh i'm not i'm not sure i just i know for example that both my Corolla and Tercel have been very good
sw3849A-ms98-a-0059 251.836375 256.494375 um and reliable that that i've i've used
sw3849A-ms98-a-0060 256.494375 266.115250 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0061 266.115250 267.632000 oh
sw3849A-ms98-a-0062 267.632000 272.871500 [silence]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0063 272.871500 273.800250 [laughter]
sw3849A-ms98-a-0064 273.800250 279.899625 i'm in Iowa City Iowa very small town and i don't i don't know if there's even uh more than a
sw3849A-ms98-a-0065 279.899625 289.476875 one or two a month i [laughter-mean] um that's that that's not a big consideration here and i just moved from Utah where i that's where i was going to school before and um 
sw3849A-ms98-a-0066 289.476875 294.950750 also there um there's i've never had that concern
sw3849A-ms98-a-0067 294.950750 298.530000 um so i'm not really i'm not really sure
