sw3861A-ms98-a-0037 248.504250 253.532000 but one of the key things then was what could we afford to do
sw3861A-ms98-a-0038 253.532000 257.361375 and i got a a co-op
sw3861A-ms98-a-0039 257.361375 262.943500 deal at one of the schools in New Mexico and i was there for a couple of years before i flunked out

sw3861A-ms98-a-0046 277.501250 285.401250 but uh it was just a very small school about three hundred students but the big the reason for choosing it was because of the financial aid that was available

sw3861A-ms98-a-0048 287.208250 289.139000 yeah yeah
