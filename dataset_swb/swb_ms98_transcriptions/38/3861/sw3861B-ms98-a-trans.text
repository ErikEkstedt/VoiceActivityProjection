sw3861B-ms98-a-0009 21.739500 25.695000 [silence]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0010 25.695000 32.925500 well to be honest they didn't really do a lot i mean my dad sat me down i guess in junior high and said
sw3861B-ms98-a-0011 32.925500 44.410750 um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know Dad said well you know you're a smart kid so
sw3861B-ms98-a-0012 44.410750 56.637125 you're going to college and you're going to graduate school so decide now what do you want to be [laughter] here here are your choices you can be a doctor a lawyer an architect uh he gave me a list of choices all you know
sw3861B-ms98-a-0013 56.637125 60.400000 the different professions and i was kind of like i didn't even know you know
sw3861B-ms98-a-0014 60.400000 62.439625 i had no clues so i said da[d]-
sw3861B-ms98-a-0015 62.439625 68.759000 well i can't stand the sight of blood so a doctor is out and uh i'm not i can't do math so a lot of stuff is out um
sw3861B-ms98-a-0016 68.759000 75.704625 i didn't think i'd be a very good architect because i like to draw but not that way so i said well i guess i'll be a lawyer because i think they help people [laughter]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0017 75.704625 77.143125 boy was i stupid
sw3861B-ms98-a-0018 77.143125 79.527750 so Dad said okay fine you're going to be a lawyer
sw3861B-ms98-a-0019 79.527750 90.150000 so then when it got time to you know get close to you know you start getting college brochures and stuff [noise] my dad kind of said well uh what's the best law school in the country
sw3861B-ms98-a-0020 90.150000 96.012375 and all his friends told him Harvard and he goes okay well i think you should go there for undergraduate too
sw3861B-ms98-a-0021 96.012375 98.141875 so i was like okay fine
sw3861B-ms98-a-0022 98.141875 103.150875 so i like uh send them the uh you know do the what do you call it
sw3861B-ms98-a-0023 103.150875 114.849000 you know send for the things you fill out and filled out the forms and um they interview you they always have one of their alums interview you and at the time i applied you had to do it through Radcliff because
sw3861B-ms98-a-0024 114.849000 119.050500 used to Harvard was for the boys and Radcliff was for the girls
sw3861B-ms98-a-0025 119.050500 121.254625 and even though they were combined
sw3861B-ms98-a-0026 121.254625 125.806875 you know even though they had to let women in Harvard you still had to apply through Radcliff so
sw3861B-ms98-a-0027 125.806875 137.297000 i did all this and uh a Radcliff alum here in Dallas [vocalized-noise] did my interview and basically Harvard has a recognized and constitutionally upheld quota system 
sw3861B-ms98-a-0028 137.297000 149.289375 and they told me that i was provisionally accepted but that if that they got a black person or Hispanic person or something that was qualified from this area that i would be bumped because i'm just a basic you know 
sw3861B-ms98-a-0029 149.289375 153.683500 wasp type person so [noise] i'm not really
sw3861B-ms98-a-0030 153.683500 157.066875 you know they had this minority recruitment thing
sw3861B-ms98-a-0031 157.066875 167.379500 so and sure enough about two weeks before school started i found out that they had taken uh they uh found a black girl
sw3861B-ms98-a-0032 167.379500 176.738875 and uh took her instead so the only thing i could do was i had to go somewhere that you could pretty much register and start the next day so
sw3861B-ms98-a-0033 176.738875 187.458750 University of Texas was where my dad went to school and luckily it's kind of that way so i went down there and late registered and basically started classes the day after i registered
sw3861B-ms98-a-0034 187.458750 189.069000 [silence]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0035 189.069000 192.016750 yeah by myself [laughter]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0036 192.016750 195.602250 i mean my parents didn't really you know my dad was the first
sw3861B-ms98-a-0037 195.602250 197.184875 well my mom
sw3861B-ms98-a-0038 197.184875 201.800250 [vocalized-noise] they were the first people in their families that had been to college
sw3861B-ms98-a-0039 201.800250 204.646875 which i know like people from the east coast
sw3861B-ms98-a-0040 204.646875 205.815750 [silence]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0041 205.815750 208.412625 colleges are all around you you know
sw3861B-ms98-a-0042 208.412625 222.241375 and so everybody goes to college or it's more normal i think because_1 a lot of my friends that are from the east coast you know everybody in their family's been to college but out here you know in fact my mother hasn't really been to college college they had a junior college
sw3861B-ms98-a-0043 222.241375 228.444875 that was fairly close by and and so she that's all she ever did was go to junior college
sw3861B-ms98-a-0044 228.444875 236.641500 just you know two year college and and got her degree but you know then my dad went back to school and finished school and went to professional school
sw3861B-ms98-a-0045 236.641500 242.439375 but that was after my brother and i were already little kids so nobody in my family really knew how to advise me
sw3861B-ms98-a-0046 242.439375 252.451125 [silence]
sw3861B-ms98-a-0047 252.451125 254.044750 oh yeah
