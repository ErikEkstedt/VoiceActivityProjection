sw3854A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.995625 [noise] do you use credit cards
sw3854A-ms98-a-0002 1.995625 3.357750 it
sw3854A-ms98-a-0003 3.357750 11.423625 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0004 11.423625 12.723250 do you
sw3854A-ms98-a-0005 12.723250 34.575750 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0006 34.575750 36.083375 uh-huh
sw3854A-ms98-a-0007 36.083375 40.153875 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0008 40.153875 41.873750 i see
sw3854A-ms98-a-0009 41.873750 46.288625 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0010 46.288625 53.576375 what is the advantage then of a gold card because um you don't pay any interest if you have a regular MasterCard or Visa
sw3854A-ms98-a-0011 53.576375 85.176125 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0012 85.176125 86.955000 i see
sw3854A-ms98-a-0013 86.955000 90.967875 i see we used to get the American Express card and
sw3854A-ms98-a-0014 90.967875 100.118125 stuff like that and then we just kind of got back to plain old MasterCard and Visa uh because we never really had any um
sw3854A-ms98-a-0015 100.118125 105.418000 benefit that we thought was worth the the price of the special card so
sw3854A-ms98-a-0016 105.418000 110.346375 uh it may change you know if we do a lot of car rental which we don't do
sw3854A-ms98-a-0017 110.346375 119.274500 or other types of services i'm sure there're some things that come along with the gold cards that are appealing and and uh i've just wondered what they were they haven't been appealing to us so far
sw3854A-ms98-a-0018 119.274500 127.636750 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0019 127.636750 139.326750 yeah that you know i think that was my original appeal uh i was i was in my twenties and the American Express card really appeals to people on that basis of of you know you've arrived you've got this card
sw3854A-ms98-a-0020 139.326750 141.327875 and uh
sw3854A-ms98-a-0021 141.327875 149.591125 you know it got to what fifty five dollars a year or something like that and my wife said well this is ridiculous why are we doing this and uh
sw3854A-ms98-a-0022 149.591125 162.741750 so we stopped doing it and we refused to pay i don't know whether you know this but my wife discovered this we started to refuse to pay our banks uh an annual fee for the that for the V[isa]- Visa and [laughter-MasterCard] and they said fine we'll give it to you anyway 
sw3854A-ms98-a-0023 162.741750 164.573500 and we said you know
sw3854A-ms98-a-0024 164.573500 177.801000 we're uh we're not interested in your card anymore and they said well wait a minute i[s]- is it the price [laughter-and] [laughter-we] said yeah so well we won't charge anymore [laughter] you know and they used to charge what eighteen dollars a year or something like that twelve dollars something like that
sw3854A-ms98-a-0025 177.801000 179.607500 so
sw3854A-ms98-a-0026 179.607500 188.194625 they're wonderful i mean i think credit cards are great we use it to get cash uh you know you can use it now in the Safeway out here in San Francisco and
sw3854A-ms98-a-0027 188.194625 191.854875 it's wonderful in that respect and we're glad to have them_1 we we
sw3854A-ms98-a-0028 191.854875 193.411750 yeah
sw3854A-ms98-a-0029 193.411750 204.055125 it's great you know and it eventually what we're gonna go to is nothing but these kinds of cards and it'll be MasterCard Visa and and American Express i don't think the Discover card's gonna make it in the long term
sw3854A-ms98-a-0030 204.055125 213.218625 um you know we don't need too many cards and and the American Express will probably survive but it'll have to become more like these other ones and become cheaper i think because_1 the price will come down
sw3854A-ms98-a-0031 213.218625 215.732500 i don't think it's worth fifty five bucks a year
sw3854A-ms98-a-0032 215.732500 221.430875 when you can use the the Visa or the MasterCard everywhere in the world and they're pitching that in all their commercials i notice
sw3854A-ms98-a-0033 221.430875 231.798250 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0034 231.798250 233.133625 yeah
sw3854A-ms98-a-0035 233.133625 236.397875 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0036 236.397875 237.773250 yeah
sw3854A-ms98-a-0037 237.773250 240.682500 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0038 240.682500 247.654875 well n[ow]- now that's interesting i can see why because then they get some sort of advantage in terms of the [vocalized-noise] conversion fee probably
sw3854A-ms98-a-0039 247.654875 253.008000 [silence]
sw3854A-ms98-a-0040 253.008000 254.235250 right
sw3854A-ms98-a-0041 254.235250 260.946125 well it it's gonna come that way and the reason it's nice is because basically what it does is put you electronically in touch with your financial resources
sw3854A-ms98-a-0042 260.946125 266.113000 anywhere in the world and that's where we're headed [noise] the technology supports that nicely
sw3854A-ms98-a-0043 266.113000 275.261000 and uh it makes more sense than than that because you have a card and if you have insurance which we have had on the card you uh can have you can lose it stolen
sw3854A-ms98-a-0044 275.261000 283.653875 and you don't get uh anything charged to you and that's great it's just insurance we're very responsible with our cards but nonetheless if we lost them
sw3854A-ms98-a-0045 283.653875 286.996000 it'd be great to know we didn't have to pay five hundred dollars or whatever
sw3854A-ms98-a-0046 286.996000 292.397375 [noise] um on the cards we look for the low rate we have USAA cards uh you know USAA
sw3854A-ms98-a-0047 292.397375 297.986000 yeah but but USAA is Dallas based and uh [noise] that's a great thing f[or]-
