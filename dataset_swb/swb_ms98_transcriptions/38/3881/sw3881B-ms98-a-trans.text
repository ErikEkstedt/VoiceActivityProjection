sw3881B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.053500 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0002 0.053500 1.352000 uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0003 1.352000 4.730625 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0004 4.730625 15.587625 i think that uh one of the things they're going to have to do is go back and take some serious look at what's important and what has a return on investment 
sw3881B-ms98-a-0005 15.587625 19.625500 uh there's an awful lot of federal programs that uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0006 19.625500 25.200250 they put a million dollars in it and it probably does a couple of hundred dollars worth of good
sw3881B-ms98-a-0007 25.200250 30.383625 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0008 30.383625 35.732250 and there's some things some programs that just don't seem to be working at all
sw3881B-ms98-a-0009 35.732250 43.801625 uh an awful lot of the social programs and welfare programs they're just seem to be self perpetuating
sw3881B-ms98-a-0010 43.801625 45.554125 and uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0011 45.554125 50.426625 uh certainly in a lot of the state and local regulations that are involved 
sw3881B-ms98-a-0012 50.426625 59.019500 just force individuals into perpetuating the same activity and gives them_1 no incentive whatever to to solve their own problems 
sw3881B-ms98-a-0013 59.019500 74.110500 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0014 74.110500 78.100000 well some of the things that happen in welfare programs that uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0015 78.100000 86.460750 they are inclined not to give welfare or reduce welfare payments if there is a uh male present in the family
sw3881B-ms98-a-0016 86.460750 94.056125 so that's resulted in uh the family dissolving the husband is thrown out of the house so that they collect the welfare
sw3881B-ms98-a-0017 94.056125 101.823375 and uh then the children are raised under the single parent circumstance without uh the father roll around
sw3881B-ms98-a-0018 101.823375 105.148250 and uh they wind up doing exactly the same thing
sw3881B-ms98-a-0019 105.148250 139.786875 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0020 139.786875 146.210250 i think we can also do a lot to eliminate an awful lot of paper work and superfluous regulation
sw3881B-ms98-a-0021 146.210250 148.455000 I know that
sw3881B-ms98-a-0022 148.455000 150.782750 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0023 150.782750 152.140000 um-hum
sw3881B-ms98-a-0024 152.140000 166.357625 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0025 166.357625 167.569625 yeah
sw3881B-ms98-a-0026 167.569625 169.110375 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0027 169.110375 171.514250 well i know that uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0028 171.514250 180.624250 well it seems like just ten or fifteen years ago when we were writing a proposal to work on some program we would sit down with an old Freidman mechanical calculator
sw3881B-ms98-a-0029 180.624250 184.995250 and work out a a one or two page cost proposal 
sw3881B-ms98-a-0030 184.995250 189.118750 and now when we write a proposal for the same magnitude of program
sw3881B-ms98-a-0031 189.118750 198.584750 we have a Compaq three eighty six and it runs for about three days and generates about three hundred pages of uh of nonsense to for somebody to go read 
sw3881B-ms98-a-0032 198.584750 201.713750 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0033 201.713750 202.890125 you know
sw3881B-ms98-a-0034 202.890125 204.621875 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0035 204.621875 209.788000 and uh you wonder if anybody every reads it and if they do why
sw3881B-ms98-a-0036 209.788000 210.927250 [laughter]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0037 210.927250 211.979250 and
sw3881B-ms98-a-0038 211.979250 216.254625 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0039 216.254625 224.777625 uh and i- i think one of the problems we're having with uh schools uh is sort of the same factor that uh
sw3881B-ms98-a-0040 224.777625 233.083875 when i was going to school we had uh a principal assistant principal and everybody else was teaching except the janitor
sw3881B-ms98-a-0041 233.083875 241.585125 and now it seems like there's uh as many administrators and administrative assistants as we have teachers
sw3881B-ms98-a-0042 241.585125 246.732125 and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent
sw3881B-ms98-a-0043 246.732125 263.925500 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0044 263.925500 264.929750 um-hum
sw3881B-ms98-a-0045 264.929750 273.070250 [silence]
sw3881B-ms98-a-0046 273.070250 279.931125 and i think that the government also goes overboard uh on the way they do things
sw3881B-ms98-a-0047 279.931125 281.953250 uh we have a
sw3881B-ms98-a-0048 281.953250 286.076375 a new sewage treatment facility near here
sw3881B-ms98-a-0049 286.076375 293.506125 that's uh one of the fine EPA approved things that does a super job of cleaning up the water
sw3881B-ms98-a-0050 293.506125 297.591750 and they have an administrative building associated with it
sw3881B-ms98-a-0051 297.591750 299.394000 that uh ha[s]-
