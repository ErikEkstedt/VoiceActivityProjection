sw3881A-ms98-a-0004 24.720000 30.331250 right i- i think they are going to be a lot more selective on on what they throw money at
sw3881A-ms98-a-0005 30.331250 58.368125 [silence]
sw3881A-ms98-a-0006 58.368125 65.338625 right people get get where they depend on the the benefit and they don't have much interest and there is no uh 
sw3881A-ms98-a-0007 65.338625 74.120125 uh enforcing uh ability i think to make sure that it doesn't get continued there's there's a lot of waste as a result i think of that
sw3881A-ms98-a-0008 74.120125 85.988125 [silence]

sw3881A-ms98-a-0015 104.884750 114.879125 yeah i think there's uh there's a good opportunity if they'll take advantage of it with the with the the defense needs not as great as they use to be uh
sw3881A-ms98-a-0016 114.879125 118.991125 if and combine the savings there with with the savings in
sw3881A-ms98-a-0017 118.991125 130.837500 all these uh give away programs and and then waste that's in welfare and a lot of other programs i think they can start to get a handle on on the budget though what i am afraid is they will just
sw3881A-ms98-a-0018 130.837500 140.161875 continue wasting money the way they have and and uh throw throw potential savings into uh more programs that don't do any good
sw3881A-ms98-a-0019 140.161875 145.986375 [silence]

sw3881A-ms98-a-0022 160.486000 168.787875 i forget the figure but it was a tremendous amount of savings that could be cut out without really cutting benefits uh just the waste that went on 
sw3881A-ms98-a-0023 168.787875 184.166250 [silence]

sw3881A-ms98-a-0036 246.252000 258.212875 well with the economy overall getting bad a lot of companies have had to really go into cost cutting and streamlining and that's something the government has never really tried hard to do uh 
sw3881A-ms98-a-0037 258.212875 264.693875 they just have to learn to live within their budget i think and and not uh allow this bunch to get out of hand like they have
sw3881A-ms98-a-0038 264.693875 273.129625 uh there's no no need in spending all of this money on on a lot of welfare and these programs when you're going into debt to do it
