sw3834B-ms98-a-0010 16.362000 18.020000 just outside of Dallas
sw3834B-ms98-a-0011 18.020000 19.650000 nice talking to you
sw3834B-ms98-a-0012 19.650000 21.751000 what's that mean we're ready to go
sw3834B-ms98-a-0013 21.751000 29.304875 okay well it uh the way it turned out it wasn't worth anything really i just don't think i've always thought that uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0014 29.304875 39.948750 it just wasn't carried on the way it should have been it wasn't carried on like a war i mean if we were in there to fight a war regardless of the reason we were there it should have been fought like a war it just uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0015 39.948750 40.748750 we
sw3834B-ms98-a-0016 40.748750 42.442375 [silence]
sw3834B-ms98-a-0017 42.442375 45.673625 well i think we'd uh we'd uh beat them i don't think uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0018 45.673625 55.593750 i don't know what would have happened twenty years later down the road with the country within and with us but uh i think if we'd uh had allowed the military people to conduct it like a war
sw3834B-ms98-a-0019 55.593750 58.199875 instead of letting the politicians and the
sw3834B-ms98-a-0020 58.199875 65.039750 and the peace [vocalized-noise] and people like that dictate the terms of the way we fought i think things would have turned out a lot differently
sw3834B-ms98-a-0021 65.039750 66.344250 [silence]
sw3834B-ms98-a-0022 66.344250 74.424750 oh yes yeah i mean it was just a two bit country always was and always will be and uh or at least it is now and there's no way
sw3834B-ms98-a-0023 74.424750 77.905250 that if we'd uh been able to take uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0024 77.905250 89.129250 use the capacity that we had the potential we had to fight a war against a country like that we would have uh what would have lost it as a war uh the long term effects well
sw3834B-ms98-a-0025 89.129250 93.480875 i uh i don't know that's that's a little tougher to answer i think uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0026 93.480875 108.074000 depends i guess on who's in office but uh i think Bush used that uh last year in the Persian Gulf uh by taking some stronger stronger measures and when the war started
sw3834B-ms98-a-0027 108.074000 112.269250 [silence]
sw3834B-ms98-a-0028 112.269250 116.879375 be more or be more offensive well once the war started once they dec[ided]-
sw3834B-ms98-a-0029 116.879375 121.996250 once they decided to fight the thing we take a take a much uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0030 121.996250 134.409000 run in there and do it as quickly as possible rather than let the thing drag on i guess what happened back in Vietnam is that uh they we escalated and uh just you know on a gradual basis and gave the
sw3834B-ms98-a-0031 134.409000 138.710000 um North Vietnamese and Viet Cong time to adjust to our uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0032 138.710000 150.771125 increases in uh personnel and so forth they just didn't go in there if they'd a sent five hundred thousand troops in there at one time initially uh i think things would have been differently but different but it uh they went from
sw3834B-ms98-a-0033 150.771125 161.808500 having the advisors uh up to that four hundred to five hundred thousand troops over a period of time a long a long number of years and as i said i think the uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0034 161.808500 165.817250 the enemy just gradually adjusted to that and
sw3834B-ms98-a-0035 165.817250 172.874375 they didn't uh the people the country the people here didn't want the war the way it turned out they didn't want it that's

sw3834B-ms98-a-0045 196.445625 203.760500 yeah there were every every night you'd come home from work and uh or school or whatever and see it on the uh the news i
sw3834B-ms98-a-0046 203.760500 211.716750 imagine that wasn't the case during World War Two or any of the other wars uh people just didn't feel like they had the involvement in it and there were a lot of
sw3834B-ms98-a-0047 211.716750 212.938250 a lot of
sw3834B-ms98-a-0048 212.938250 217.501250 [silence]
sw3834B-ms98-a-0049 217.501250 219.085875 uh-huh

sw3834B-ms98-a-0052 221.451125 225.602875 right yeah but uh i just uh
sw3834B-ms98-a-0053 225.602875 229.133250 i i guess i was in my let's see
sw3834B-ms98-a-0054 229.133250 241.628250 my twenties during during most of that war and i i never did think that they were they were doing it right i i'm just not a uh a fan of Jane Fonda and people like her i mean that she'd go around speaking on different campuses and
sw3834B-ms98-a-0055 241.628250 253.708500 getting people uh aroused about the whole thing and of course uh they always talked about the vocal minority and i guess that's what it was the solid majority and the vocal minority and
sw3834B-ms98-a-0056 253.708500 260.015625 people were listening to to her and i guess politicians were too but i just felt
sw3834B-ms98-a-0057 260.015625 271.196750 i was in the service at that time i wasn't over there but i just felt that they fought the thing i mean they just didn't fight it like they should have and it's a war whether a war is right or wrong you i mean if you're over there and
sw3834B-ms98-a-0058 271.196750 275.320000 people or young people men or women are dying they ought to fight it as a war and
sw3834B-ms98-a-0059 275.320000 289.706750 either win or lose based on the fact that it's a war and not just uh uh mealy mouth their their way through the thing and try to get the um other side to give up on the basis of what they thought we had in terms of power and so forth
sw3834B-ms98-a-0060 289.706750 290.919750 [silence]
sw3834B-ms98-a-0061 290.919750 300.162000 oh yeah it would sure shorten the time and reduce the number of casualties and so forth we might have lo[st]- i i i just don't think we could have lost the the
