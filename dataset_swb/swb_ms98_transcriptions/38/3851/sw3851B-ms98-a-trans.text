sw3851B-ms98-a-0075 254.538375 262.374875 uh get or acquire they they think that the 401K could be used as a as a retirement plan i guess that's what some people are doing
sw3851B-ms98-a-0076 262.374875 265.167500 but there's no retirement plan at all
sw3851B-ms98-a-0077 265.167500 267.900000 [silence]
sw3851B-ms98-a-0078 267.900000 275.515750 in fact they're using a company down there in Austin 401K management company to administer the pro[gram]- it switched to them over the well last month 
sw3851B-ms98-a-0079 275.515750 287.496125 but uh they made a nice presentation so the company decided to go with them but that's one thing they could use as a retirement plan unless you do unless you are committed to using your 401K as a as a retirement program 
sw3851B-ms98-a-0080 287.496125 290.361250 but they don't have any kind of retirement plan
sw3851B-ms98-a-0081 290.361250 297.285125 oh yes yeah and they do too they match it up to a certain percent you can contribute up to fifteen percent depending on your salary
