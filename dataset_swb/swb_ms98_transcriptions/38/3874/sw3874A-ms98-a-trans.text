sw3874A-ms98-a-0014 60.864875 69.295250 are you one of those people that tends to like to go through the paper first thing in the morning over coffee or breakfast or something or do you tend to like to read at the end of the day
sw3874A-ms98-a-0015 69.295250 71.503625 yes that's the way i am
sw3874A-ms98-a-0016 71.503625 75.079250 [silence]

sw3874A-ms98-a-0028 104.456625 114.874375 sometimes it feels as though what i'm reading in the newspaper is the old news it's as if i heard it just the day before on the television and i wonder where they get a lot of their stories but i think that
sw3874A-ms98-a-0029 114.874375 126.683125 the one that i'm i feel like i get the most information from is is uh McNeil Lehrer and sometimes it's on in the afternoon if i'm if i'm home but i work most the time so um
sw3874A-ms98-a-0030 126.683125 131.633250 the program in San Francisco is on from six to seven which is ideal because
sw3874A-ms98-a-0031 131.633250 133.074250 [silence]
sw3874A-ms98-a-0032 133.074250 143.823625 yes you're preparing dinner but you still have an opportunity to to look at it occasionally we have a little two year old so there's not a lot of time to for me i feel to spend as much time with the
sw3874A-ms98-a-0033 143.823625 149.869000 updates as i'd like to i think i probably get more of it from Lee because he works out of our home and um
sw3874A-ms98-a-0034 149.869000 155.522500 [laughter-can] [laughter-give] [laughter-me] [laughter-information] about what might've happened that day if he watched the afternoon McNeill Lehrer
sw3874A-ms98-a-0035 155.522500 162.943375 [silence]
sw3874A-ms98-a-0036 162.943375 173.256250 it it seems to me that McNeil Lehrer spends more time with each issue therefore i can count on it being more accurate uh because they've really spent more
sw3874A-ms98-a-0037 173.256250 177.199750 development of the story as well as research and
sw3874A-ms98-a-0038 177.199750 189.270125 and i get a better picture of what it is that i'm hearing about i- i wonder about the authenticity of the others um i- i have a feeling they get a lot from UPI and AP and maybe they count on what they get from those reporters and
sw3874A-ms98-a-0039 189.270125 191.908125 just give little spots to it and
sw3874A-ms98-a-0040 191.908125 196.333875 [silence]
sw3874A-ms98-a-0041 196.333875 197.736125 um-hum

sw3874A-ms98-a-0045 211.184625 223.803250 right and certainly in that situation there was an effort to exclude the press from some activities because they didn't want to have a lot of political fall out i [laughter-think] but there was probably
sw3874A-ms98-a-0046 223.803250 236.183250 some repetition of of stories that didn't have complete um confirmation i wondered that about the whole Clinton thing recently um you know something coming out in the tabloids and being picked up by a major media
sw3874A-ms98-a-0047 236.183250 247.903625 uh one of the accusations obviously is that they didn't go down there and research it and and get enough information i don't have a preference or an opinion really on that story one way or the other but it's uh
sw3874A-ms98-a-0048 247.903625 251.561750 it's clear that there's a lot of [laughter-controversy] [laughter-about] [laughter-it]

sw3874A-ms98-a-0056 270.908125 278.432875 uh-huh [noise] but it is always interesting to hear the follow ups you know on any kind of major presentation you always get the analysis
