sw3879B-ms98-a-0005 10.570500 12.893750 [silence]
sw3879B-ms98-a-0006 12.893750 20.163125 well i uh was in college when the war escalated to it's height and uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0007 20.163125 21.979000 [silence]
sw3879B-ms98-a-0008 21.979000 28.921625 i guess my feeling is consistent with that of uh the general public that it was unfortunate
sw3879B-ms98-a-0009 28.921625 31.418500 event uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0010 31.418500 37.235000 it's real interesting to think about it in the context of this new movie JFK which is
sw3879B-ms98-a-0011 37.235000 48.626125 apparently linking the Kennedy assassination to his decision to hi[s]- uh uh the apparently people uh who worked for Kennedy say he didn't decide that he was going to 
sw3879B-ms98-a-0012 48.626125 56.719375 pull out of Vietnam was not going to commit more troops that that had nothing to do with the assassination of those people say but they that he had come to that conclusion
sw3879B-ms98-a-0013 56.719375 59.368000 i think it was uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0014 59.368000 66.771125 particularly in light of recent events a really unfortunate mistake Communism was self destructing even then and uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0015 66.771125 77.725125 the history of Vietnam which has been uh represented in a number of different commentaries and documentaries one on the public broadcasting system
sw3879B-ms98-a-0016 77.725125 83.681000 uh it seems that it just didn't have to happen and i think uh its a valuable
sw3879B-ms98-a-0017 83.681000 86.911875 uh if painful lesson for this country
sw3879B-ms98-a-0018 86.911875 88.846500 [silence]
sw3879B-ms98-a-0019 88.846500 90.314000 right
sw3879B-ms98-a-0020 90.314000 93.005250 at the time i wasn't that uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0021 93.005250 100.953125 wasn't that sure i- i- i really didn't know enough about it and wasn't that politically active uh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0022 100.953125 103.362625 but it was
sw3879B-ms98-a-0023 103.362625 104.826375 um
sw3879B-ms98-a-0024 104.826375 106.157250 [silence]
sw3879B-ms98-a-0025 106.157250 114.446250 apparently something that could've been avoided and i you know i- i look at wars generally as falling into that category um
sw3879B-ms98-a-0026 114.446250 123.804250 [noise] people are beginning to wonder whether or not the uh the Gulf War could've been avoided even though that was a remarkably painless war and as wars go
sw3879B-ms98-a-0027 123.804250 138.438000 [silence]
sw3879B-ms98-a-0028 138.438000 139.857625 right

sw3879B-ms98-a-0032 151.047250 163.566125 well i think what what's uh i- i guess i'd use the word relevant to the Vietnam War question is that the Vietnam War was apparently avoidable too it was a time when Ho Chi Minh
sw3879B-ms98-a-0033 163.566125 171.074125 apparently came to the United States and said look if you're willing to provide me with support all i wanna do is unify Vietnam
sw3879B-ms98-a-0034 171.074125 176.092000 and uh he was turned away by Truman um
sw3879B-ms98-a-0035 176.092000 178.153125 so it's
sw3879B-ms98-a-0036 178.153125 180.182625 hum
sw3879B-ms98-a-0037 180.182625 192.842500 a painful lesson i guess one that we're beginning to learn i'm really impressed by how much effect some of these movies have had on public consciousness the JFK movie's cause causing one person after another to
sw3879B-ms98-a-0038 192.842500 197.314625 call for the release of the documents that have been sealed
