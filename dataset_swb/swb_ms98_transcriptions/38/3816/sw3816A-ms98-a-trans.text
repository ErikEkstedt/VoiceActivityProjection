sw3816A-ms98-a-0016 50.542750 60.880000 that's true yeah i'd i'd have to i'd think once or twice but i think i'd probably do it just for the experience i guess but it'd be pretty interesting that's for sure

sw3816A-ms98-a-0022 74.523375 78.233250 you think it'll ever happen where they'll let it'll be common or

sw3816A-ms98-a-0033 102.251500 112.331875 yeah i'm i'm kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station they're talking about you know i think that'd be [noise] a step to where you know in the right direction but 
sw3816A-ms98-a-0034 112.331875 114.255750 [silence]
sw3816A-ms98-a-0035 114.255750 115.989875 uh-huh

sw3816A-ms98-a-0040 123.736875 130.720000 yeah i'd uh just the way we progress i- i like i say i'd hate to see them_1 cut out the the budget there's a lot of places 
sw3816A-ms98-a-0041 130.720000 140.030500 you know that can use it but [noise] just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission [vocalized-noise] yeah things they developed
sw3816A-ms98-a-0042 140.030500 141.308500 you know
sw3816A-ms98-a-0043 141.308500 146.373250 [vocalized-noise] in that program you know i m[ean]- m[ean]- mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but
sw3816A-ms98-a-0044 146.373250 153.009750 you know that's as an offshoot it's kind of like the military budget you know there's a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military
sw3816A-ms98-a-0045 153.009750 160.016625 that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but
sw3816A-ms98-a-0046 160.016625 165.541625 if it hadn't of been for something like that you'd never you know really you may not have got it so

sw3816A-ms98-a-0052 177.703750 179.871125 well they said yeah
sw3816A-ms98-a-0053 179.871125 188.352000 uh-huh they say in you know in weightlessness they're they're able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they can't do with the gravity so
sw3816A-ms98-a-0054 188.352000 192.088250 there could be some val[uable]- i guess there's a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i
sw3816A-ms98-a-0055 192.088250 193.733875 yeah i think it's
sw3816A-ms98-a-0056 193.733875 199.224750 they've been a little concerned because it's kind of chilly it's cold you know like you say so they're a little worried about the
sw3816A-ms98-a-0057 199.224750 208.549125 same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some o[rganisms]- uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh
sw3816A-ms98-a-0058 208.549125 217.840125 how they react to that and everything but so i think i think you're right though they're getting little better and better s[ooner]- s[ooner]- you know sooner or later they're going to make some major breakthroughs
sw3816A-ms98-a-0059 217.840125 224.739625 [silence]
sw3816A-ms98-a-0060 224.739625 226.057750 uh-huh
sw3816A-ms98-a-0061 226.057750 230.854250 yeah it's just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes with[out]- nothing ever comes without some effort so
