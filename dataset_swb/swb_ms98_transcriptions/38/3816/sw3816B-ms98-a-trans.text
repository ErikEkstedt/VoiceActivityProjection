sw3816B-ms98-a-0003 3.235250 14.166500 well i think they ought to s[pend]- uh i don't think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i don't see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh
sw3816B-ms98-a-0004 14.166500 23.817875 heck i don't know i don't i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they haven't all that much yet uh other than the little things they've developed in this space shuttle
sw3816B-ms98-a-0005 23.817875 27.015000 the little experiments that they've done and so forth you know
sw3816B-ms98-a-0006 27.015000 33.608750 in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and i'd go tomorrow
sw3816B-ms98-a-0007 33.608750 36.067375 if i had a chance [laughter]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0008 36.067375 38.293375 yeah right [laughter]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0009 38.293375 39.573625 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0010 39.573625 51.229375 well i don't know i just it would be something i've never experienced before weightlessness i'd love to experience weightlessness that's something i've always uh thought would be fascinating you know
sw3816B-ms98-a-0011 51.229375 54.660875 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0012 54.660875 56.143125 yeah
sw3816B-ms98-a-0013 56.143125 58.022125 yeah i think so
sw3816B-ms98-a-0014 58.022125 59.198000 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0015 59.198000 73.028000 when they had the uh accident you know ba[ck]- the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i won't go you [laughter-know] but uh since then i thought well what the heck i'd go if it would be a one ti[me]- once in lifetime experience i'd try it
sw3816B-ms98-a-0016 73.028000 75.243125 no i don't think so [laughter]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0017 75.243125 76.955625 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0018 76.955625 81.740625 uh it might it it very well may uh i think it's sort a
sw3816B-ms98-a-0019 81.740625 89.620375 had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch
sw3816B-ms98-a-0020 89.620375 97.344625 and everything i think gee you know [vocalized-noise] they'll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch
sw3816B-ms98-a-0021 97.344625 103.071750 so i don't know you know they seems like they sort of bog down they're not really progressing right now to me
sw3816B-ms98-a-0022 103.071750 107.194500 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0023 107.194500 108.883750 yeah yeah
sw3816B-ms98-a-0024 108.883750 110.496875 yeah
sw3816B-ms98-a-0025 110.496875 124.412250 yeah well i believe that uh they'll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here [laughter] at that time i think they'll i think they'll eventually do that
sw3816B-ms98-a-0026 124.412250 131.866500 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0027 131.866500 133.217750 right

sw3816B-ms98-a-0041 162.933500 169.139875 yeah well that's true that's true and i guess they've got a lot of uh they've done a lot of medical tests
sw3816B-ms98-a-0042 169.139875 174.437375 uh in space too and uh i m[ean]- i don't know what they've they've actually come up with
sw3816B-ms98-a-0043 174.437375 177.657500 but uh i know that medicine is another
sw3816B-ms98-a-0044 177.657500 181.862500 area that they u[sed]- that they've used in space a lot you know
sw3816B-ms98-a-0045 181.862500 184.989000 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0046 184.989000 186.472875 that's right

sw3816B-ms98-a-0060 215.541250 221.186000 i th[ink]- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of
sw3816B-ms98-a-0061 221.186000 225.595625 sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh they'll it will come to them
sw3816B-ms98-a-0062 225.595625 226.725750 [noise] you know [noise]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0063 226.725750 230.031375 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0064 230.031375 240.238875 that's right well you know talking about the weightlessness i've uh i've uh noticed that they've talked about like these Russian astronauts that stay up there for nearly a year
sw3816B-ms98-a-0065 240.238875 248.305250 you know they have a lot of problems with the i'm not sure what it is with the the muscle m[uscle]- tone and so forth because_1 they uh
sw3816B-ms98-a-0066 248.305250 257.939000 they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but it's not the same as exercising with gravity and the i i'm not sure exactly
sw3816B-ms98-a-0067 257.939000 264.114125 what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness
sw3816B-ms98-a-0068 264.114125 275.164125 yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess
sw3816B-ms98-a-0069 275.164125 277.586000 [silence]
sw3816B-ms98-a-0070 277.586000 290.544875 i- i'm not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i- i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh w[hen]- when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they w[alk]- they couldn't walk very well
sw3816B-ms98-a-0071 290.544875 299.522000 when they finally made it back into gravity and uh i'm not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but i'm not sure physiologically what happened
