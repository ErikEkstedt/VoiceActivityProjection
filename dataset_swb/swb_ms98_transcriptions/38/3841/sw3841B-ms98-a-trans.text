sw3841B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.075625 [noise]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0002 1.075625 4.383250 uh yeah something about the school system here
sw3841B-ms98-a-0003 4.383250 10.133125 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0004 10.133125 15.275125 well then i'll uh i'll walk softly [laughter]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0005 15.275125 28.299375 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0006 28.299375 29.536125 yeah
sw3841B-ms98-a-0007 29.536125 36.831625 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0008 36.831625 39.364375 what school system does she teach in
sw3841B-ms98-a-0009 39.364375 41.253000 oh wow
sw3841B-ms98-a-0010 41.253000 69.745875 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0011 69.745875 74.961750 well i think it's more of a there's a bigger problem here than uh
sw3841B-ms98-a-0012 74.961750 82.228375 than discipline in the schools i think it gets back to the uh parental uh participation into the program
sw3841B-ms98-a-0013 82.228375 91.808125 um to give you an example both of my children are in the academy system in the Garland School District and it's a public system however you'd think that it was a private school
sw3841B-ms98-a-0014 91.808125 99.827250 because they've taken it the best teachers and the best students they've taking top three percent that have tested out you know in the district
sw3841B-ms98-a-0015 99.827250 109.506250 and uh put them in this academy system and to get into the system's very difficult but once you're in uh they have they have self-paced programs
sw3841B-ms98-a-0016 109.506250 120.567500 and so you have students that wanna learn and uh you have teachers that wanna teach and you have parents that are really interested in the children and basically uh
sw3841B-ms98-a-0017 120.567500 130.008875 [vocalized-noise] there's probably some discrimination if you wanna say [laughter-that] uh because [noise] most of the people that are in the academy system 
sw3841B-ms98-a-0018 130.008875 135.824750 uh are Caucasian and because you have to test into the system
sw3841B-ms98-a-0019 135.824750 148.411125 and most of that's not all true but i'm saying a large percentage of them_1 are and also the other large percentage is is that all the parents just about of these kids uh have college degrees at least one parent does
sw3841B-ms98-a-0020 148.411125 153.780625 and so there's i think that uh that's my justification for saying that
sw3841B-ms98-a-0021 153.780625 162.946500 the parents that are that are pushing their children at home even if they don't know what their children are learning they're they're saying do your homework let me see it
sw3841B-ms98-a-0022 162.946500 166.838000 don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you [laughter]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0023 166.838000 180.876750 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0024 180.876750 182.461875 [laughter-yeah]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0025 182.461875 197.326250 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0026 197.326250 209.068250 yeah i think what we've done is um um especially looking at um the South Dallas area is that we're trying to bring the education 
sw3841B-ms98-a-0027 209.068250 214.880125 level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed
sw3841B-ms98-a-0028 214.880125 217.463750 [silence]
sw3841B-ms98-a-0029 217.463750 227.115375 and um that also probably crosses over into business because now businesses also say that if you're not don't have the proper education
sw3841B-ms98-a-0030 227.115375 229.744500 uh including uh
sw3841B-ms98-a-0031 229.744500 238.376375 exposure to high tech fields such as computer technology if you can't use a computer today and do word processing and do
sw3841B-ms98-a-0032 238.376375 248.279875 uh database management and do i forget all the other stuff financial management and all this other kind of stuff in your regular job uh you can't function 
sw3841B-ms98-a-0033 248.279875 256.170500 you know so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world and the business world then says we're not going to pay you
sw3841B-ms98-a-0034 256.170500 264.502625 unless you have the education and then educ[ation]- and then then we what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself
sw3841B-ms98-a-0035 264.502625 298.466000 [silence]
