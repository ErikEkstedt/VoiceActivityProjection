sw3829B-ms98-a-0004 19.269000 20.500000 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0005 20.500000 27.995375 yeah well actually the past couple days has made me want to get out there and get started but [noise] i figure i'd just be wasting my time
sw3829B-ms98-a-0006 27.995375 29.978000 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0007 29.978000 37.758250 uh i've always maintained our homes as far as repairs and things like that except maybe i don't do heaters and air conditioners but
sw3829B-ms98-a-0008 37.758250 41.916125 i usually do everything else right up to replacing dishwashers and things
sw3829B-ms98-a-0009 41.916125 54.098000 uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago
sw3829B-ms98-a-0010 54.098000 56.656875 what about you what kind of house you live in
sw3829B-ms98-a-0011 56.656875 87.931375 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0012 87.931375 99.770500 about two years ago we bought a house out at Smithville which is like forty miles east of Austin over toward Houston uh little old stucco house built in nineteen twenty one and uh
sw3829B-ms98-a-0013 99.770500 103.291875 we bought it t[o]- f[or]- to g[et]- for a weekend getaway
sw3829B-ms98-a-0014 103.291875 115.346625 and it needed a lot of work but we saw it when we first looked at it we can do this and uh sure enough uh it's oh nineteen months later we sold it for twenty six and we bought it for sixteen five
sw3829B-ms98-a-0015 115.346625 127.725500 and we did things like paint uh inside and outside and basically repaired the garages we put in expensive ceiling fans which was kind of dumb on my part but
sw3829B-ms98-a-0016 127.725500 140.961750 it was something i thought the place needed because_1 it had real high ceilings and uh just and just in general did everything we uh put in a hot water heater a new toilet and things like that kind of remodeled the kitchen cabinets
sw3829B-ms98-a-0017 140.961750 143.820875 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0018 143.820875 151.102375 well [noise] we weren't th[ink]- talking about reselling it when we started doing it we were looking for something to do on weekends
sw3829B-ms98-a-0019 151.102375 158.012000 and it because_1 my wife loves to pick out paint and experiment and if it doesn't work try another color things like that
sw3829B-ms98-a-0020 158.012000 168.871375 so but when the offer came to us it was from a neighbor and they wanted their mother close to them_1 and we thought well you know we're not we hadn't been out here but what once in three months and
sw3829B-ms98-a-0021 168.871375 175.275125 and we had just bought this house in Austin so we thought well what the heck let's make a little money on it [laughter]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0022 175.275125 176.337625 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0023 176.337625 179.654500 [noise] yeah i'd like to uh
sw3829B-ms98-a-0024 179.654500 186.182625 we have bought new homes in the past and and we'll never do that again because it was just boring f[or]- after about a week
sw3829B-ms98-a-0025 186.182625 188.149125 [laughter-yeah] so
sw3829B-ms98-a-0026 188.149125 200.802875 uh out in New Mexico one time we bought a really run down oh terribly run down home and uh it took us a year and a half to turn it around and make almost forty five thousand in profit on it
sw3829B-ms98-a-0027 200.802875 202.989750 and that was just
sw3829B-ms98-a-0028 202.989750 208.797500 yeah uh it's just we you know we map out what we want to do and we go for it uh
sw3829B-ms98-a-0029 208.797500 218.758625 whoever's got time to do it and course you get the major things done like your you know have the floors redone or have carpet put in whatever but the rest of it we usually do ourselves
sw3829B-ms98-a-0030 218.758625 235.238000 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0031 235.238000 244.799250 yeah i uh i think about that from time to time because_1 we've never actually you know built one that we wanted you know the way we wanted it and things like that but
sw3829B-ms98-a-0032 244.799250 249.577375 i'm not sure that our interest is that piqued in it to do something like that
sw3829B-ms98-a-0033 249.577375 252.652250 [silence]
sw3829B-ms98-a-0034 252.652250 260.102750 yeah reno[vation]- renovation is kind of where we're at like our our favorite TV program is This Old House has been for many years
sw3829B-ms98-a-0035 260.102750 266.523375 and we would like to get ahold of something really old and redo it uh
sw3829B-ms98-a-0036 266.523375 278.950625 there again we might go back out to Smithville and buy another home [laughter] and because they're so it's a town that time has passed by so there are a lot of old big homes and they're fairly inexpensive
sw3829B-ms98-a-0037 278.950625 280.303500 so
sw3829B-ms98-a-0038 280.303500 293.507625 it's forty miles uh it's on the it's on the river and it's a quite nice little town they've been able to keep out a lot of businesses and things i mean there's no KMarts or anything like that around so
sw3829B-ms98-a-0039 293.507625 295.381125 makes it kind of nice
sw3829B-ms98-a-0040 295.381125 298.626000 [silence]
