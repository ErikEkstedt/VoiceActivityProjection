sw3842A-ms98-a-0020 56.911125 59.775625 yeah it's real relaxation
sw3842A-ms98-a-0021 59.775625 64.275375 uh my father ran a service station for thirty nine years and his
sw3842A-ms98-a-0022 64.275375 76.808625 i mean w[hen]- when i was a kid i didn't realize how true it was but he always said that that was the best way he knew of to win[d]- to wind down after a hard day at work was to come home and put in a hard day in the garden
sw3842A-ms98-a-0023 76.808625 83.004875 and especially you know just hoeing ju[st]- hoeing up the weeds it was [vocalized-noise] therapy to him
sw3842A-ms98-a-0024 83.004875 86.465375 and i guess it still is but uh
sw3842A-ms98-a-0025 86.465375 91.047375 and i didn't seem that way when i was like ten years old but
sw3842A-ms98-a-0026 91.047375 103.076875 oh yeah yeah um we had about a quarter of an acre worth of lawn between our m[y]- my parents' house and our next door neighbor
sw3842A-ms98-a-0027 103.076875 106.774500 they were a rather elderly couple so we cut their lawn for them_1
sw3842A-ms98-a-0028 106.774500 108.731875 but uh
sw3842A-ms98-a-0029 108.731875 112.169750 there's about a half acre worth of garden we kept
sw3842A-ms98-a-0030 112.169750 114.179250 so when the kids and
sw3842A-ms98-a-0031 114.179250 116.035625 dad we
sw3842A-ms98-a-0032 116.035625 124.593625 we kept it worked up pretty well it was a lot of fun as long as [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [vocalized-noise] your heart was in it at l[east]- least to some extent or another
sw3842A-ms98-a-0033 124.593625 125.708250 [silence]
sw3842A-ms98-a-0034 125.708250 131.538250 well uh since i moved away from home i got to live in a place that had a yard
sw3842A-ms98-a-0035 131.538250 134.782375 so [laughter] [laughter-i] not really
sw3842A-ms98-a-0036 134.782375 139.175625 [silence]
sw3842A-ms98-a-0037 139.175625 146.198375 yes we've actually gotten to the point where uh for a while i couldn't seem to keep anything alive
sw3842A-ms98-a-0038 146.198375 148.886625 i couldn't even grow weeds in the house
sw3842A-ms98-a-0039 148.886625 160.575500 but about three years ago my wife and i somehow another seemed to have turned into green thumbs we got we pinched off a uh a c[ouple]- couple of a twigs from a house plant of her mother's
sw3842A-ms98-a-0040 160.575500 165.104000 and wrapped them in a wet paper towel and brought them_1 home with us
sw3842A-ms98-a-0041 165.104000 177.259625 and put them_1 in a jar of Miracle Grow and water and these this thing took off and we planted them_1 and now it's a plant uh [vocalized-noise] plant we pinched them off of was kind of full and leafy but it was only about
sw3842A-ms98-a-0042 177.259625 183.580250 eight inches high off the top of the pot this thing's about five feet tall now
sw3842A-ms98-a-0043 183.580250 185.803750 a[nd]- i don't know
sw3842A-ms98-a-0044 185.803750 190.395375 [noise] i[t]- it's this you know some little broad leaf something or other we
sw3842A-ms98-a-0045 190.395375 199.529750 but uh it's it's got real thick thick stalks to it that like i say it's the couple of those stalks over five feet tall
sw3842A-ms98-a-0046 199.529750 209.675250 but uh they're just growing like mad once we got that thing going we wound up with about five or six other house plants that are all doing real well some people gave us some aloe vera and it
sw3842A-ms98-a-0047 209.675250 213.081375 it's doing well i mean it's had it's bad spots but
sw3842A-ms98-a-0048 213.081375 218.999875 uh it's had its rough times but yeah but it's it's doing real well now um
sw3842A-ms98-a-0049 218.999875 221.741375 i brought her a uh a couple o[f]-
sw3842A-ms98-a-0050 221.741375 235.842750 i don't even know what they're called looks like overly large lawn grass but it just a broad leaf type of [along/lawn] net kind of like a a leaf on a stalk of corn but uh greener it's [vocalized-noise] 
sw3842A-ms98-a-0051 235.842750 238.068375 short house plant pardon
sw3842A-ms98-a-0052 238.068375 244.198500 [silence]
sw3842A-ms98-a-0053 244.198500 257.398375 yeah well it doesn't get a stalk the the leaves all come out of the center it doesn't really resemble corn other than the shape of the leaf itself it i[s]- about_1 like the shape of a leaf a leaf on a stalk of corn but it's not on a
sw3842A-ms98-a-0054 257.398375 259.825500 stalk it's just all out of the center
sw3842A-ms98-a-0055 259.825500 266.676250 [silence]
sw3842A-ms98-a-0056 266.676250 275.421125 yeah and uh it doesn't seem to flower any and let's see we've got a little somebody gave us a Fichus and uh
sw3842A-ms98-a-0057 275.421125 280.606000 uh when we first got it no well we came close we got really close
sw3842A-ms98-a-0058 280.606000 290.428875 um when we first got it she kept moving it back and forth from our own front porch to the uh inside and she never could quite decide where she wanted it inside
sw3842A-ms98-a-0059 290.428875 298.690000 and it had shed almost all its leaves it looked really scraggly and rough and when somebody finally told us the only way to treat those things is to put them some place and leave them_1
