sw3877B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 2.290875 [noise]
sw3877B-ms98-a-0002 2.290875 14.060125 well i was pretty encouraged by what happened this year and and i think with all those draft choices that i hear that they have uh they ought to be able to pick up a few more players that would help them
sw3877B-ms98-a-0003 14.060125 20.440625 so i'd i'd have to say i think that the J J Boys have done well [laughter]
sw3877B-ms98-a-0004 20.440625 33.993250 oh i- i don't think there is any question that Aikman has to be the the starter because he's got the physical tools i mean that other Beuerlein stepped in and did a wonderful job
sw3877B-ms98-a-0005 33.993250 46.646375 but i don't think that you can until Troy loses the job on his own merits i think the job has to be his now that he's healthy again now if he doesn't perform then i guess the other guy is waiting to step in the wings
sw3877B-ms98-a-0006 46.646375 48.558875 [silence]
sw3877B-ms98-a-0007 48.558875 53.795375 but h[e's]- but that guy's got his head screwed on right he's not causing a controversy

sw3877B-ms98-a-0011 65.167375 75.453125 yeah and uh but he d[oesn't]- he doesn't like it he doesn't want that he just wants to go out and do his job when he gets a chance to play he kind of i think wants to let his actions
sw3877B-ms98-a-0012 75.453125 78.151625 speak for themselves pretty well
sw3877B-ms98-a-0013 78.151625 80.659375 [silence]

sw3877B-ms98-a-0029 162.742625 177.279500 lack of getting through this year to to the quarterback i think it's been i think it's been a variety of things they have had several key injuries in certain spots and couple close ball games could have gone one way or another and
sw3877B-ms98-a-0030 177.279500 184.411125 and uh you know they are still one of the premier uh four or five teams in the league and they're always one to beat
sw3877B-ms98-a-0031 184.411125 188.247625 so i don't think there is gonna to be any question they are going to be up there again
sw3877B-ms98-a-0032 188.247625 193.356625 another thing is some of their guys are getting a little older because_1 they have been up there for a while
