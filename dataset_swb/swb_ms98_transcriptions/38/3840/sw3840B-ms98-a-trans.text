sw3840B-ms98-a-0003 4.863625 12.957000 [noise] well uh as a former uh professor in a university and having been through college uh
sw3840B-ms98-a-0004 12.957000 17.348750 and graduate school myself i guess my own um
sw3840B-ms98-a-0005 17.348750 21.470250 advice would be to first try to assess the needs of the
sw3840B-ms98-a-0006 21.470250 22.481250 [silence]
sw3840B-ms98-a-0007 22.481250 29.242875 the kid um some kids do very well in large universities
sw3840B-ms98-a-0008 29.242875 37.414000 and other kids do very well in junior colleges and other kids do very well in residential college environments um
sw3840B-ms98-a-0009 37.414000 43.357125 and i think it really depends upon the individual the safest bet for most people who want uh
sw3840B-ms98-a-0010 43.357125 53.506250 uh a good quality experience is a private college where they're gonna get an opportunity to have more personal contact and uh
sw3840B-ms98-a-0011 53.506250 59.794000 where they're going to be forced by the circumstances to learn more than might be the case in a big university
sw3840B-ms98-a-0012 59.794000 61.505375 [silence]
sw3840B-ms98-a-0013 61.505375 70.628875 no i went to a big university i went um i went to Pitt as an undergraduate and i looked at small colleges and frankly um
sw3840B-ms98-a-0014 70.628875 77.661125 [noise] i think i had this sense that it would have been more difficult at small colleges and i think it wou[ld]- would have been definitely i mean i
sw3840B-ms98-a-0015 77.661125 88.297125 i graduated Phi Beta Kappa summa cum laude and went on to do a PhD and i think that uh had i gone to a small college i might have learned a lot more but i don't think my grades would have been nearly as good
sw3840B-ms98-a-0016 88.297125 94.434500 i think you can get away with more in a big uh a big university uh what what kind of experience have you had in this regard
sw3840B-ms98-a-0017 94.434500 100.068750 [silence]

sw3840B-ms98-a-0035 199.429000 206.422375 what i think is one of the problems with with a kid going to a large university generally and this happens at Stanford at Cal out here
sw3840B-ms98-a-0036 206.422375 216.135125 [noise] i- i think that the the residential college experience is generally the best for most kids some kids are particular[ly]- pardon me
sw3840B-ms98-a-0037 216.135125 221.596625 well i mean uh let me let me give you an example of a college that would fit that description
sw3840B-ms98-a-0038 221.596625 228.320250 um i would say that uh some of the best colleges in the country
sw3840B-ms98-a-0039 228.320250 235.661625 are small residential colleges like Swarthmore College like um Amherst Wesleyan Williams College
sw3840B-ms98-a-0040 235.661625 243.279125 um [noise] those are places that that in academia are generally regarded as the best places to get liberal arts educations
sw3840B-ms98-a-0041 243.279125 257.418500 [noise] on the other hand you can go to a big university and do very well and some big universities i don't know whether Bringham Young is like this but some have a small college feel to them you don't get a lot of foreign TAs y[ou]- i mean in other words that the people who teach really know how to teach
sw3840B-ms98-a-0042 257.418500 262.231500 and i think that's what important for a lot of kids uh in my case
sw3840B-ms98-a-0043 262.231500 269.545375 [noise] i went through uh between sixty eight and seventy two in college and it was just this big uh grade game for me
sw3840B-ms98-a-0044 269.545375 274.457250 and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area
sw3840B-ms98-a-0045 274.457250 285.268000 um but i was years out of graduate school i had worked in industry before i ever came back and wanted to use my training as a scientist [noise] to um
sw3840B-ms98-a-0046 285.268000 290.853500 you know to get anything done and as matter of fact i'm i'm working on a book and a theory
sw3840B-ms98-a-0047 290.853500 298.466000 uh which has its foundations ultimately in theoretical physics and i'd never would have imagined myself wanting to do something like that i had such a neg[ative]-
