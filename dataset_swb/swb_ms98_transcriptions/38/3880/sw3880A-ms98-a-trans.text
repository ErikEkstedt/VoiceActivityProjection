sw3880A-ms98-a-0018 55.613250 59.432375 but it was is still has an interesting plot twist to it
sw3880A-ms98-a-0019 59.432375 62.085375 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0020 62.085375 64.342000 yeah trying to

sw3880A-ms98-a-0023 71.083500 72.139500 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0024 72.139500 76.431750 it just seems so much trouble any more to go to a theater
sw3880A-ms98-a-0025 76.431750 87.489000 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0026 87.489000 88.835250 yeah

sw3880A-ms98-a-0033 114.926625 118.009500 sometimes you're right it doesn't uh
sw3880A-ms98-a-0034 118.009500 121.220750 but it beats watching what ever is on [laughter-television]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0035 121.220750 129.751875 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0036 129.751875 130.681875 yeah
sw3880A-ms98-a-0037 130.681875 132.294875 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0038 132.294875 140.565500 we had a pretty quiet Christmas at our house this year and one of the things that we've been putting off for a long time was to was to rent all of the Godfather movies
sw3880A-ms98-a-0039 140.565500 141.626375 [noise]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0040 141.626375 143.001875 so we did that
sw3880A-ms98-a-0041 143.001875 144.189000 and [noise]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0042 144.189000 149.312875 it was uh you know like fourteen hours of Godfather stuff
sw3880A-ms98-a-0043 149.312875 153.383000 no it took us about three days but
sw3880A-ms98-a-0044 153.383000 161.239625 yeah well it was still lots i'm telling you when that that the last hour you know number three 
sw3880A-ms98-a-0045 161.239625 168.430625 we felt like we were Italians we were eating Italian snacks and drinking wine and we were thinking this has got to stop
sw3880A-ms98-a-0046 168.430625 170.390500 there's three
sw3880A-ms98-a-0047 170.390500 174.213000 yeah it's almost something around fourteen hours
sw3880A-ms98-a-0048 174.213000 177.187000 [laughter]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0049 177.187000 179.971250 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0050 179.971250 185.888875 uh but m[y]- i think my favorite though are old movies black and white
sw3880A-ms98-a-0051 185.888875 186.979625 uh
sw3880A-ms98-a-0052 186.979625 191.629000 i like the old prison movies in the thirties and things like that
sw3880A-ms98-a-0053 191.629000 196.019000 it's just i don't know there's just something about them_1 i think it reminds me of my childhood
sw3880A-ms98-a-0054 196.019000 202.161125 not [vocalized-noise] i just remember you know when i was little in the summer we got to stay up all night and that's what was on 
sw3880A-ms98-a-0055 202.161125 211.167875 so somehow that reminds me again with all my brothers and sisters and you know making popcorn and making homemade pizzas in the middle of the night and stuff so
sw3880A-ms98-a-0056 211.167875 221.047250 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0057 221.047250 222.080625 yeah
sw3880A-ms98-a-0058 222.080625 223.955000 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0059 223.955000 229.129000 i watched uh Doris Day Retrospective on uh CBS the other night just
sw3880A-ms98-a-0060 229.129000 236.485750 i thing about her and different movies she'd been in and i realized how much i missed the old Doris Day Rock Hudson movies
sw3880A-ms98-a-0061 236.485750 241.592625 they were just always i can remember never missing one at the theater
sw3880A-ms98-a-0062 241.592625 253.437000 and because they were like fantasy and and they were an escape from the real world i think and even if i see one on now or somewhere i'll want to watch it so
sw3880A-ms98-a-0063 253.437000 259.277125 [silence]
sw3880A-ms98-a-0064 259.277125 261.611000 yeah i am still here yes
