sw3802B-ms98-a-0003 1.659250 5.077750 oh okay great i'm in Addison here
sw3802B-ms98-a-0004 5.077750 8.660250 [silence]

sw3802B-ms98-a-0006 10.079500 17.989250 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0007 17.989250 29.320375 i do uh quite a bit of sailing i own a sailboat that i keep parked up on the scout lot of my scout troop [noise] and we take it out and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts but
sw3802B-ms98-a-0008 29.320375 39.360375 [noise] i haven't really been taking it out recreationally too much lately [laughter] since it's i don't have a trailer hitch on my car anymore so it's hard for me to get it somewhere but
sw3802B-ms98-a-0009 39.360375 52.825375 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0010 52.825375 63.867625 yeah this one is not that big it's a day sailer it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of
sw3802B-ms98-a-0011 63.867625 68.962250 stuck your body out the whole [laughter] it back into the main part of the sailboat but [noise]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0012 68.962250 73.894000 but it's there they can be black holes to throw money into [laughter]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0013 73.894000 77.235750 boats are kind of expensive to maintain
sw3802B-ms98-a-0014 77.235750 89.109500 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0015 89.109500 95.611875 especially a bigger one the bigger they are if you get a big cabin cruiser or a big ski boat
sw3802B-ms98-a-0016 95.611875 102.961000 power boat then there's always uh stuff to go wrong with it the sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up but you still have to
sw3802B-ms98-a-0017 102.961000 113.762500 worry with the hull and the condition of the sails and spars and rigging uh everything that's in it it takes a [noise] a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up but
sw3802B-ms98-a-0018 113.762500 143.092250 [silence] 
sw3802B-ms98-a-0019 143.092250 157.670875 well it's a lot of fun i think um just from the standpoint of [noise] getting away from the dodge here and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long a boat can be a lot of relaxation
sw3802B-ms98-a-0020 157.670875 170.413875 uh to especially with a group of friends and cook out or camp out or whatever uh or a cabin or something depending on how much you like to rough it an[d]- but it's uh [noise]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0021 170.413875 177.110375 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0022 177.110375 178.905500 [noise]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0023 178.905500 186.294625 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0024 186.294625 189.181875 use the boat for transportation
sw3802B-ms98-a-0025 189.181875 190.559375 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0026 190.559375 196.495250 they just go across the boat and get a an[d]- tie it up and go in huh [laughter]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0027 196.495250 202.447375 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0028 202.447375 204.598625 yeah that would be fun
sw3802B-ms98-a-0029 204.598625 205.718750 [silence]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0030 205.718750 219.216375 [noise] i've just never [noise] i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh Rice next year so he's going off but
sw3802B-ms98-a-0031 219.216375 231.350875 um once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else and uh i- i don't have to worry about a lot of other scheduling things where i've actually got the time to go out and enjoy it uh
sw3802B-ms98-a-0032 231.350875 241.060000 i might do something differently i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them_1 keep it and maybe consider getting a a better one for me uh
sw3802B-ms98-a-0033 241.060000 246.962625 yeah i think i would uh i the sailing part of it i like uh because it's so quiet
sw3802B-ms98-a-0034 246.962625 251.427375 and if you get a big enough one then you've got a little motor on it also
sw3802B-ms98-a-0035 251.427375 255.661625 where if it's light wind you can still putt around a little bit and have fun
sw3802B-ms98-a-0036 255.661625 263.811750 or if or if the wind dies you're not stuck in the middle of the lake i've with my little one i've been out there many times on a calm summer day
sw3802B-ms98-a-0037 263.811750 272.686500 where all of a sudden the wind stops and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in and
sw3802B-ms98-a-0038 272.686500 279.453250 and that gets hot and and wearisome doing that and if you ha[ve]- if you're ha[ve]- big enough boat to have the little
sw3802B-ms98-a-0039 279.453250 286.231750 auxiliary motor on there at least you can kind of drop the sails and putt on back in [laughter]
sw3802B-ms98-a-0040 286.231750 295.826375 [noise] but it's fun [noise] i own an insurance agency a managing general a wholesaler of insurance uh out in Addison and uh
sw3802B-ms98-a-0041 295.826375 298.466000 i'm a scout leader though so i'm i'm out wi[th]-
