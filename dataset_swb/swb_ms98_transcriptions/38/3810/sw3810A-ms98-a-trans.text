sw3810A-ms98-a-0009 38.575625 49.637250 he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby
sw3810A-ms98-a-0010 49.637250 59.795375 uh [noise] my husband and my other son who's eleven [noise] just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man
sw3810A-ms98-a-0011 59.795375 63.323500 yeah and it was lots of fun
sw3810A-ms98-a-0012 63.323500 64.916500 [silence]
sw3810A-ms98-a-0013 64.916500 66.086875 um
sw3810A-ms98-a-0014 66.086875 72.162375 basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre
sw3810A-ms98-a-0015 72.162375 80.426875 [noise] and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band
sw3810A-ms98-a-0016 80.426875 90.491125 so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school [noise] and my daughter takes piano lessons too
sw3810A-ms98-a-0017 90.491125 104.940500 but uh we just really like music it's a i- i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we [laughter] get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music
sw3810A-ms98-a-0018 104.940500 107.816250 [silence]
sw3810A-ms98-a-0019 107.816250 109.291000 um-hum
sw3810A-ms98-a-0020 109.291000 111.801125 [silence]
sw3810A-ms98-a-0021 111.801125 116.152125 um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki
sw3810A-ms98-a-0022 116.152125 125.668500 [noise] which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear[ning]- by hearing the intervals and things like that
sw3810A-ms98-a-0023 125.668500 128.127000 i teach uh [noise]
sw3810A-ms98-a-0024 128.127000 134.545750 like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play what's on the piano
sw3810A-ms98-a-0025 134.545750 139.171125 but he can't learn like that he's a delayed child he's only about
sw3810A-ms98-a-0026 139.171125 143.796375 i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things
sw3810A-ms98-a-0027 143.796375 148.829875 and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it
sw3810A-ms98-a-0028 148.829875 156.736750 uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do s[omething]- do something you know educationally
sw3810A-ms98-a-0029 156.736750 161.862875 so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though

sw3810A-ms98-a-0036 196.018625 208.626750 that's really hard i think because especially if you start them_1 and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i don't want to do this anymore and you're like
sw3810A-ms98-a-0037 208.626750 216.848750 G[od]- i really want you to do it [noise] you know so sometimes it's hard to to know exactly when but
sw3810A-ms98-a-0038 216.848750 224.006875 i don't know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it
