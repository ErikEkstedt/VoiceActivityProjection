sw3810B-ms98-a-0043 167.565250 173.082875 well i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of
sw3810B-ms98-a-0044 173.082875 180.286125 just turning five because_1 she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is 
sw3810B-ms98-a-0045 180.286125 188.395625 is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just 
sw3810B-ms98-a-0046 188.395625 196.903250 so i wasn't sure when to start her i didn't want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene

sw3810B-ms98-a-0053 228.605000 239.110375 knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so 
sw3810B-ms98-a-0054 239.110375 252.696625 [noise] um i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight [noise] or or should i say seven i mean she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but 
sw3810B-ms98-a-0055 252.696625 264.445625 um so [noise] yeah [noise] uh so i'm kind of you know just playing with it but at this point we're going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but
