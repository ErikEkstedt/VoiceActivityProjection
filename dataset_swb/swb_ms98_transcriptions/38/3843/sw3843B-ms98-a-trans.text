sw3843B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.332625 [noise]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0002 0.332625 1.656625 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0003 1.656625 5.806750 uh probably not from what i've been hearing i mean there's not enough getting done
sw3843B-ms98-a-0004 5.806750 17.243625 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0005 17.243625 18.243500 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0006 18.243500 24.202250 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0007 24.202250 28.714750 well you think this AIDS thing has been around since about nineteen eighty and
sw3843B-ms98-a-0008 28.714750 31.723625 i would have thought by now they'd have been a lot more advances
sw3843B-ms98-a-0009 31.723625 36.682125 in treatment and then again i guess there is i mean there's some drugs that they didn't have and
sw3843B-ms98-a-0010 36.682125 39.024500 i'm sure that didn't come cheap
sw3843B-ms98-a-0011 39.024500 54.935375 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0012 54.935375 56.002375 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0013 56.002375 57.220000 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0014 57.220000 58.559750 it's pretty uh
sw3843B-ms98-a-0015 58.559750 64.407875 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0016 64.407875 66.780500 yeah i keep thinking that myself
sw3843B-ms98-a-0017 66.780500 74.506625 i i was i last year when the war thing was going on and it was over and they said it costed you know like seventy billion or something
sw3843B-ms98-a-0018 74.506625 79.092000 and they said if they had that much money for AIDS research they could have found found a cure
sw3843B-ms98-a-0019 79.092000 81.260375 so i kind of wondered about that i mean
sw3843B-ms98-a-0020 81.260375 82.067875 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0021 82.067875 85.889125 to me that's an astronomical amount of money [laughter] and uh
sw3843B-ms98-a-0022 85.889125 89.684250 but it suddenly comes from somewhere i don't know where it comes from but
sw3843B-ms98-a-0023 89.684250 106.973875 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0024 106.973875 108.146250 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0025 108.146250 116.714500 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0026 116.714500 120.798000 there again that doesn't seem like a whole lot of money
sw3843B-ms98-a-0027 120.798000 124.034500 you know if to do something like that with
sw3843B-ms98-a-0028 124.034500 132.628500 uh but i i kind of agree with you we should spend more in this country for not only AIDS but a lot of other things before we start helping other countries
sw3843B-ms98-a-0029 132.628500 135.173625 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0030 135.173625 136.257875 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0031 136.257875 140.625250 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0032 140.625250 141.715250 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0033 141.715250 147.518125 i mean in in in your own financial budget if if you're not doing well you're not going to help out anyone else
sw3843B-ms98-a-0034 147.518125 155.380000 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0035 155.380000 159.533000 but but that's not the way this country is or ever been i think we've always
sw3843B-ms98-a-0036 159.533000 163.603125 they had reasons for it i think i heard one just the other day that
sw3843B-ms98-a-0037 163.603125 174.194000 because of all the money he was you know giving away right now uh the president was i think his wife said something with well like we've got to keep these countries in a democratic mode
sw3843B-ms98-a-0038 174.194000 176.809500 uh sometimes i don't think it matters
sw3843B-ms98-a-0039 176.809500 194.792875 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0040 194.792875 196.040625 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0041 196.040625 205.365250 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0042 205.365250 209.389125 my wife and i used to work at a research laboratory for the government
sw3843B-ms98-a-0043 209.389125 211.718625 and i know things go slow
sw3843B-ms98-a-0044 211.718625 216.079125 an incredible amount of money is spent to achieve little or nothing sometimes
sw3843B-ms98-a-0045 216.079125 217.966625 so i understand
sw3843B-ms98-a-0046 217.966625 220.622875 you know where the money gets ate up at and
sw3843B-ms98-a-0047 220.622875 222.859375 but there really should just be more
sw3843B-ms98-a-0048 222.859375 223.964875 and now that
sw3843B-ms98-a-0049 223.964875 228.550250 yeah and now that uh you know the weapon spending is going down
sw3843B-ms98-a-0050 228.550250 235.119375 but we could put some of these laboratories even like the one we worked at at Los Alamos we could put them onto you know more AIDS things
sw3843B-ms98-a-0051 235.119375 240.648625 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0052 240.648625 242.744000 not that i know of
sw3843B-ms98-a-0053 242.744000 250.206000 i think that where we used to live we had a neighbor down the street and i heard a rumor that one of them died with AIDS
sw3843B-ms98-a-0054 250.206000 255.544000 but i never knew for sure i met them once or twice because they used to sell plants in the yard but
sw3843B-ms98-a-0055 255.544000 258.952000 i never really considered that i knew them so
sw3843B-ms98-a-0056 258.952000 259.961625 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0057 259.961625 260.926500 yeah
sw3843B-ms98-a-0058 260.926500 279.878750 [silence]
sw3843B-ms98-a-0059 279.878750 281.111750 yeah
