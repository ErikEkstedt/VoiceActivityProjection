sw3843A-ms98-a-0005 6.253000 9.133500 yeah i just kind of wonder uh you know i've been thinking
sw3843A-ms98-a-0006 9.133500 15.187625 i don't know how much they spend on cancer and how much they spend on AIDS and some of those other things but it seems like uh
sw3843A-ms98-a-0007 15.187625 24.675250 you know it needs to be somewhat equitable i guess as far as the number of people that are affected uh cancer seems to affect a lot more people and you'd think they need to spend more on that but
sw3843A-ms98-a-0008 24.675250 27.160125 [silence]

sw3843A-ms98-a-0015 38.588000 43.819625 yeah that's true it's uh i don't know it's kind of interesting issue you wonder
sw3843A-ms98-a-0016 43.819625 54.755250 now it's gotten so out of hand that you know it's not just that the homosexual population and stuff like that uh you know it's affected everybody just even if you go to a hospital it's
sw3843A-ms98-a-0017 54.755250 56.934250 kind of hard to know what to do and
sw3843A-ms98-a-0018 56.934250 61.415375 you really i don't even think they have really a de[cent]- a decent idea of how many people really have it i
sw3843A-ms98-a-0019 61.415375 64.323625 i would imagine a lot more people have it than they think and

sw3843A-ms98-a-0034 89.442875 99.754500 and you just wonder i you know i look at kind of now too where we're getting all this people asking us for aid outside the country you know or to [vocalized-noise] support the Soviet Union this that and the other and
sw3843A-ms98-a-0035 99.754500 108.421875 you know i sometimes wonder if it's not time we started you know maybe turning some of that stuff back towards home and helping some of those problems and you know AIDS being one of them to
sw3843A-ms98-a-0036 108.421875 116.627125 i think didn't the President put i don't know if it was a billion or so more dollars or something in the budget this well i guess it was in ninety one to try and find a cure for it or

sw3843A-ms98-a-0044 132.091500 137.531500 yeah it's kind of kind of ironic ourselves we're on the down trend and here we are trying to still pick other people up and
sw3843A-ms98-a-0045 137.531500 141.469250 seems like that's all we ever do and it comes back to haunt us in the [laughter-long] run
sw3843A-ms98-a-0046 141.469250 142.580500 but
sw3843A-ms98-a-0047 142.580500 146.558500 [silence]
sw3843A-ms98-a-0048 146.558500 155.635750 yeah yeah that's true i mean that you might that you want to try and be charitable but yet you got to take care of your own house and put your own house in order before you start dishing out to everybody else and

sw3843A-ms98-a-0057 178.004500 181.219750 yeah i i i agree that just
sw3843A-ms98-a-0058 181.219750 190.383375 and and like i say what do we really get out of it a lot of times you know [vocalized-noise] i guess if we didn't help the Soviet Union there could be just total chaos and go back to the old order but 
sw3843A-ms98-a-0059 190.383375 195.357625 you know we're either paying for it in weapons and arms or we're paying we're giving it to them for nothing you know
sw3843A-ms98-a-0060 195.357625 205.488500 and then we you know at least we have jobs when we're making all the weapons and stuff it seemed like and now we don't even have those because we cut back so much and then we give it away and you just wonder what we really get out of it

sw3843A-ms98-a-0085 258.538625 260.152375 just more passing but
sw3843A-ms98-a-0086 260.152375 270.532125 yeah i just i haven't had anything strike home so it really hasn't hit me as bad and and somet[imes]- you know you tend to sometimes wonder well hey you know you kind of brought it on yourself but like i say now it's getting so much more in
sw3843A-ms98-a-0087 270.532125 277.575375 into society that people that you know have no intention of doing anything you know kind of end up with it and
sw3843A-ms98-a-0088 277.575375 280.472875 you know little kids and stuff like that that
sw3843A-ms98-a-0089 280.472875 286.353125 that is it's and i say i don't have any idea how much and there ought to be probably a lot more spent to
sw3843A-ms98-a-0090 286.353125 291.813625 to find out i just i just hope they kind of keep things in perspective and remember there's a bunch of other
sw3843A-ms98-a-0091 291.813625 297.616250 you know type diseases out there it seems you hear a lot more about the AIDS activists than you do these other people with these other diseases and
