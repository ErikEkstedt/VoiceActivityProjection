sw3826B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.073375 [noise]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0002 0.073375 3.913625 so the question is how do we keep up with current events 
sw3826B-ms98-a-0003 3.913625 10.239125 as a matter of fact as you called i was uh taking a look at uh the San Francisco Examiner
sw3826B-ms98-a-0004 10.239125 11.562375 yeah
sw3826B-ms98-a-0005 11.562375 13.037375 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0006 13.037375 21.874625 uh i watch the MacNeil Lehrer news hour fairly regularly and uh the network news less often
sw3826B-ms98-a-0007 21.874625 27.199375 and will watch some of the talking heads programs on PBS
sw3826B-ms98-a-0008 27.199375 33.475750 uh and that's pretty much about it we don't get Time or Newsweek um
sw3826B-ms98-a-0009 33.475750 37.912875 and uh as a matter of fact i don't get any of those sort of of magazines anymore
sw3826B-ms98-a-0010 37.912875 44.588000 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0011 44.588000 48.328375 yeah do you watch the network news
sw3826B-ms98-a-0012 48.328375 57.499000 yeah out here they're moving it to a seven o'clock uh well they're moving the prime time schedule up from
sw3826B-ms98-a-0013 57.499000 63.136625 uh eight to eleven which used to be eight o'clock at night till eleven o'clock at night now to seven to ten
sw3826B-ms98-a-0014 63.136625 66.934500 and i guess the network news which has moved up in time out here
sw3826B-ms98-a-0015 66.934500 72.318875 um will move up on all three of the local network affiliates
sw3826B-ms98-a-0016 72.318875 79.581375 i was just reading as a matter of fact about the news coverage of the movie JFK have you have you s[een]-
sw3826B-ms98-a-0017 79.581375 88.240500 yeah it's really interesting to listen to how different people [noise] uh approach different topics um
sw3826B-ms98-a-0018 88.240500 99.239375 it the i didn't realize this but uh Dan Rather at CBS was the first person to view this Zapruder film that was actually made of the assassination
sw3826B-ms98-a-0019 99.239375 111.681250 and he had viewed it the day after and uh got it completely backwards in terms of what had happened that was significant because of the obvious contention that there were two gunmen at least and not one
sw3826B-ms98-a-0020 111.681250 122.492125 and uh it's really interest[ing]- and he Rather wr[ote]- later admitted that he'd gotten the key piece of uh uh evidence backwards that he'd argued like a lot of other people that Kennedy had lurched forward
sw3826B-ms98-a-0021 122.492125 128.295125 after the shot and he'd in fact been uh forced backward which lends credence to the two
sw3826B-ms98-a-0022 128.295125 132.222875 uh to the two gunmen conspiracy theory have you seen the movie
sw3826B-ms98-a-0023 132.222875 133.748375 i haven't either
sw3826B-ms98-a-0024 133.748375 136.569375 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0025 136.569375 138.040375 yeah
sw3826B-ms98-a-0026 138.040375 146.476125 it is uh you know i uh are you one of those people who believes that it was uh not a lone gunman that that we just never really got the full story
sw3826B-ms98-a-0027 146.476125 151.086750 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0028 151.086750 158.297125 yeah i- i haven't seen the movie either but i- i think most of us in this country believe that it just doesn't make sense that it was one guy
sw3826B-ms98-a-0029 158.297125 159.902500 and uh
sw3826B-ms98-a-0030 159.902500 162.356750 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0031 162.356750 172.411500 well that's what Oliver Stone's seeking to do and i- i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes
sw3826B-ms98-a-0032 172.411500 175.415625 uh really important news comes to people through movies
sw3826B-ms98-a-0033 175.415625 176.865875 through television
sw3826B-ms98-a-0034 176.865875 177.973125 [silence]
sw3826B-ms98-a-0035 177.973125 184.503375 yeah and and i think that's really interesting i know that um uh my wife and i were talking about
sw3826B-ms98-a-0036 184.503375 198.476375 how uh much uh attitudes toward women uh and and the relationships between men and women husband's and wives uh are changing and i think people get more of that information
sw3826B-ms98-a-0037 198.476375 203.133625 through television sitcoms than they do through reading the newspaper
sw3826B-ms98-a-0038 203.133625 215.446125 uh that was the topic of yesterday's T I conversation and and uh i think it's really interesting because i think all of those things wind up carrying the message and i think uh um
sw3826B-ms98-a-0039 215.446125 224.850000 it's gonna be real interesting to see where we go with all of the selective channels that people are going to be able to get via cable television and computer services
sw3826B-ms98-a-0040 224.850000 229.930625 so much uh so much more than we can possibly consume in the way of news
sw3826B-ms98-a-0041 229.930625 232.043000 [silence]
