sw3805A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.253000 [noise]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0002 0.253000 3.926125 um go ahead tell me what you think do we get our money's worth
sw3805A-ms98-a-0003 3.926125 13.044625 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0004 13.044625 15.722375 yeah did you see Sixty Minutes last night
sw3805A-ms98-a-0005 15.722375 24.525500 well they did a [noise] thing on the the thirty five billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need and uh
sw3805A-ms98-a-0006 24.525500 26.271500 it's staggering
sw3805A-ms98-a-0007 26.271500 50.660625 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0008 50.660625 55.129000 well there are a lot of things that people i think generally
sw3805A-ms98-a-0009 55.129000 56.187375 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0010 56.187375 60.235375 well i think it's interesting to look at um
sw3805A-ms98-a-0011 60.235375 70.075000 where the money [vocalized-noise] goes and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go and and i don't think generally i think what's interesting is
sw3805A-ms98-a-0012 70.075000 81.559750 that [noise] we probably represent the majority of people in this country in terms of their feelings about the government and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with
sw3805A-ms98-a-0013 81.559750 92.211625 and that what i think is gonna be really interesting is what we do about it i mean we are gonna have to change the people who represent us
sw3805A-ms98-a-0014 92.211625 98.566375 i mean and i think it's gonna be real interesting to see and and then force upon them uh
sw3805A-ms98-a-0015 98.566375 102.319750 yeah right that's y[our]- i think that's the only thing that's gonna change it a[nd]-
sw3805A-ms98-a-0016 102.319750 107.475625 o[ur]- our anger is gonna have to to give rise to to more activity on our part
sw3805A-ms98-a-0017 107.475625 120.610250 um i've i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active and in our society uh there's very little full employment most people in this country are getting worse off not better off
sw3805A-ms98-a-0018 120.610250 127.888500 eighty percent of the public according to Bill Moyer's uh recent uh piece for uh Public Broadcasting
sw3805A-ms98-a-0019 127.888500 135.304875 [noise] which by the way is a very good use of government money i think PBS is wonderful but this special
sw3805A-ms98-a-0020 135.304875 145.073875 focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are are seeing their real incomes and thus standards of living decline and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve
sw3805A-ms98-a-0021 145.073875 148.682000 that's not a formula for a better society
sw3805A-ms98-a-0022 148.682000 149.983625 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0023 149.983625 153.152875 and the government really plays a role in this
sw3805A-ms98-a-0024 153.152875 154.657750 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0025 154.657750 160.720125 i mean [vocalized-noise] w[ell]- well they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful inter[est]-
sw3805A-ms98-a-0026 160.720125 161.726250 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0027 161.726250 168.793000 you know and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not
sw3805A-ms98-a-0028 168.793000 173.572250 likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of of the voter revolting
sw3805A-ms98-a-0029 173.572250 184.505375 but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't and they think it's unfair and when they recognize it's their tax money they're gonna do more about it
sw3805A-ms98-a-0030 184.505375 191.496375 i th[ink]- i'll tell you one quick uh one thing very interesting CBS after the State of the Union address is gonna open up a telephone line
sw3805A-ms98-a-0031 191.496375 197.928500 an eight hundred number and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country they expect
sw3805A-ms98-a-0032 197.928500 203.161875 [noise] opening it for one hour that they'll get three hundred thousand telephone calls
sw3805A-ms98-a-0033 203.161875 211.580000 and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to p[ut]- create an eight hundred number for voters to call and and vent their frustration with government
sw3805A-ms98-a-0034 211.580000 225.670250 like one eight hundred capitol or something like that you know you just a number you could call from anywhere anytime i think that's coming and i think once once people really start to communicate how they feel things are going to change until then
sw3805A-ms98-a-0035 225.670250 240.394000 i think you know it's gonna be really painful so the question is how soon are we gonna start to get our money's worth and as you said it's how soon we get involved and i think we need to create mechanisms to allow us to get involved like allowing us to call a toll free number and say hey look
sw3805A-ms98-a-0036 240.394000 248.303250 do it this way not that way or i like this or i don't like that or this is how i feel about your spending my money on art that i don't think is art
sw3805A-ms98-a-0037 248.303250 254.551500 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0038 254.551500 265.354000 [noise] well that's the good thing about what is happening because_1 i think more and more the news media which takes a heck of a beating and and deserves some of it [noise] is telling us m[ore]- you know about the problems
sw3805A-ms98-a-0039 265.354000 274.267750 so the more we communicate hey look we want a change here because you know as it turns out we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country
sw3805A-ms98-a-0040 274.267750 276.997125 over a very long period of time
sw3805A-ms98-a-0041 276.997125 280.245500 um and uh
sw3805A-ms98-a-0042 280.245500 282.680250 [laughter-right]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0043 282.680250 284.437500 yeah
sw3805A-ms98-a-0044 284.437500 290.397375 [silence]
sw3805A-ms98-a-0045 290.397375 299.554000 [laughter] well you may be right [vocalized-noise] what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a
