sw3831B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.468625 [noise] [vocalized-noise] 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0002 0.468625 1.850875 okay uh
sw3831B-ms98-a-0003 1.850875 3.330125 yeah Middle East and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0004 3.330125 12.323125 [vocalized-noise] [vocalized-noise] 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0005 12.323125 16.381500 yeah i guess last week was the uh anniversary of everything but uh
sw3831B-ms98-a-0006 16.381500 20.571375 that's that's one of those [laughter] messed up areas i mean it's just
sw3831B-ms98-a-0007 20.571375 26.926125 i i i think that the whole op[eration]- you know the idea of peace ever being achieved over there is just kind of a
sw3831B-ms98-a-0008 26.926125 33.591625 i don't know i mean that we're going to have peace you can have maybe s[ome]- little more stability that what they have right now but
sw3831B-ms98-a-0009 33.591625 40.300125 it's just that's pure hatred between the Israelis and the uh Arabs i mean it's just
sw3831B-ms98-a-0010 40.300125 44.590250 i just don't think they can coexist i mean because they're not ever going to you know
sw3831B-ms98-a-0011 44.590250 47.287500 it's just too many problems that
sw3831B-ms98-a-0012 47.287500 71.427625 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0013 71.427625 72.921125 right
sw3831B-ms98-a-0014 72.921125 117.517125 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0015 117.517125 118.773750 uh-huh
sw3831B-ms98-a-0016 118.773750 122.613125 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0017 122.613125 126.506125 yeah i'm i'm amazed uh Israel didn't even uh
sw3831B-ms98-a-0018 126.506125 130.553000 you know retaliate that that that's one of the most surprising things [vocalized-noise] 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0019 130.553000 131.617625 i'm but 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0020 131.617625 158.281625 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0021 158.281625 160.706000 yeah in fact Baker was uh
sw3831B-ms98-a-0022 160.706000 166.708000 a speech yesterday trying to get them back they're supposed to be going back to tables pretty soon the next week or two i think but 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0023 166.708000 172.303000 uh they'll you know they'll work out some type of an agreement and something will pop up in about five years and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0024 172.303000 180.893125 the fact that we never got uh Hussein out hopefully that will fall apart [vocalized-noise] on its own in the next year or so but 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0025 180.893125 188.024125 i mean if he ever gets any type of military power back i mean for that area that's just going to be same situation again and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0026 188.024125 189.817375 i don't know Bush
sw3831B-ms98-a-0027 189.817375 195.559750 i just think should have gone in and just t[ake]- take him out that would have that was a major problem
sw3831B-ms98-a-0028 195.559750 197.613125 just him being just
sw3831B-ms98-a-0029 197.613125 204.540875 he's powerless but still the fact that he's still in power it's over there that's a symbol of
sw3831B-ms98-a-0030 204.540875 210.742500 he stood up to the evil force of the western world and i mean that's just completely different mode of thinking and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0031 210.742500 216.642750 to them what they v[iew]- view as reality is just simply opposite of what we view but
sw3831B-ms98-a-0032 216.642750 218.773625 so i it's
sw3831B-ms98-a-0033 218.773625 225.952250 i just i don't know the only thing that keeps us there is the oil and i guess the only good thing that came out of it is we would be paying twice as much more now for gas but
sw3831B-ms98-a-0034 225.952250 226.933000 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0035 226.933000 228.173375 i mean
sw3831B-ms98-a-0036 228.173375 231.057875 [silence]
sw3831B-ms98-a-0037 231.057875 234.912250 well it is for the money makers out there i guess but
sw3831B-ms98-a-0038 234.912250 238.330500 i don't know it's it's kind of hard for me to really
sw3831B-ms98-a-0039 238.330500 243.842500 imagine i mean i've never even been over in that part of the world and i had a friend of mine that got back and 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0040 243.842500 250.611375 he's sort of there and he's just said that he just really he couldn't stand the the
sw3831B-ms98-a-0041 250.611375 255.759375 uh Saudis at all because_1 he said they just didn't have any respect for them at all and just 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0042 255.759375 257.363125 y[eah]- they didn't
sw3831B-ms98-a-0043 257.363125 260.062250 he just really had a hard time you know
sw3831B-ms98-a-0044 260.062250 263.331625 you know i- i look at it as a he looked at it as a job he wasn't like 
sw3831B-ms98-a-0045 263.331625 269.048750 because_1 he didn't like the people and no one did he said they just didn't they didn't want them over there the people they didn't like them and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0046 269.048750 274.163125 you know they had all these rules you couldn't bring any type of religious artifacts in or
sw3831B-ms98-a-0047 274.163125 277.514000 any type of alcohol anything like that he's just
sw3831B-ms98-a-0048 277.514000 283.741750 and they they have like this they look down at the sol[diers]- the American soldiers and he said it's just
sw3831B-ms98-a-0049 283.741750 287.536750 you have a hard time you know fighting for their cause
sw3831B-ms98-a-0050 287.536750 293.049375 and to me to it's i don't know it's just it's just totally backward everything you know black is white and
sw3831B-ms98-a-0051 293.049375 296.369125 white is black to them i mean that doesn't make sense but
sw3831B-ms98-a-0052 296.369125 298.562000 [silence]
