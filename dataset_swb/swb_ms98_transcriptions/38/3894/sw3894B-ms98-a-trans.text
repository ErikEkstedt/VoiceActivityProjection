sw3894B-ms98-a-0002 0.046750 3.542625 the federal budget [noise] boy
sw3894B-ms98-a-0003 3.542625 6.237125 i was just writing something down that
sw3894B-ms98-a-0004 6.237125 10.292125 came to mind as i observed what's happened in our society
sw3894B-ms98-a-0005 10.292125 11.796500 um
sw3894B-ms98-a-0006 11.796500 14.337625 we i think have become
sw3894B-ms98-a-0007 14.337625 20.862125 uh dependent upon our federal government to do things for us that really only we can do for ourself
sw3894B-ms98-a-0008 20.862125 24.833000 and i think more and more people are recognizing that and in addition to that
sw3894B-ms98-a-0009 24.833000 26.290750 uh
sw3894B-ms98-a-0010 26.290750 31.030125 we have elected people who really don't know how to manage
sw3894B-ms98-a-0011 31.030125 35.011375 the money uh they collect
sw3894B-ms98-a-0012 35.011375 49.623125 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0013 49.623125 60.718500 i mean i think it really affects all of us to a degree Glen i think we are i mean i- i went through a P H D program that was funded by the Office of Navel Research that's now investigating Stanford and Harvard and MIT
sw3894B-ms98-a-0014 60.718500 66.340125 i mean we're talking about things that have done some good but have institutionalized corruption
sw3894B-ms98-a-0015 66.340125 68.393125 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0016 68.393125 72.364250 [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] uh you know i hate to admit that in a way but it's true
sw3894B-ms98-a-0017 72.364250 85.990500 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0018 85.990500 91.759750 right well and we need to spend the money better i mean we do not need eight hundred military bases around the world
sw3894B-ms98-a-0019 91.759750 100.326000 there are lot of things we don't we don't need to be subsidizing tobacco farmers we don't need to be subsidizing water rights for people who are wealthy fa[rm]- i mean basically
sw3894B-ms98-a-0020 100.326000 109.060250 you know it it is really true that this this country is suffering because um we are it's not that we don't have the resources we are just squandering them
sw3894B-ms98-a-0021 109.060250 116.913500 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0022 116.913500 121.387750 that's the way it was working on a defense department contract that's what happ[ened]-
sw3894B-ms98-a-0023 121.387750 123.295750 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0024 123.295750 126.294750 right well that's the way the that's the way the thing works
sw3894B-ms98-a-0025 126.294750 128.013500 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0026 128.013500 141.162250 that's right i've seen that happen and it's it what's even sadder and what i think is the the tragic part of it that you see in this case of Stanford and MIT and these other universities that are now being investigated for criminal violations 
sw3894B-ms98-a-0027 141.162250 150.714875 [noise] is that i think the attitude develops that we deserve this because we're the smart guys and without us society can't function and that that's no license to steal
sw3894B-ms98-a-0028 150.714875 158.755500 i mean i- i honest to God believe that's wh[at]- what's been going on and that was sort of seeped into the way we operated in those contexts
sw3894B-ms98-a-0029 158.755500 164.983000 and at the time i you know people i mean it was it was acceptable it's no longer acceptable
sw3894B-ms98-a-0030 164.983000 173.085250 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0031 173.085250 174.595750 right
sw3894B-ms98-a-0032 174.595750 184.474250 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0033 184.474250 195.756375 right and it it's not up to the federal government necessarily to do a lot of things that people are now thinking it ought to do for example determine what industry should survive and what shouldn't survive
sw3894B-ms98-a-0034 195.756375 203.077375 and do a a you know variety of other things if we put the money in the right place which is investing in people in the development of human capital 
sw3894B-ms98-a-0035 203.077375 217.440500 in retraining programs for these poor people who really kind of went through school and got an high school education and thought they'd be able to at least function in a competitive marketplace or went through college or or went out into the marketplace and
sw3894B-ms98-a-0036 217.440500 223.241250 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0037 223.241250 224.527000 right
sw3894B-ms98-a-0038 224.527000 225.563250 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0039 225.563250 238.873375 well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a Harvard MIT or Stanford education if it's that good and you really
sw3894B-ms98-a-0040 238.873375 255.601750 [silence]
sw3894B-ms98-a-0041 255.601750 263.605500 right but all the people [laughter-who] who are responsible for handling these kids were trained in universities and colleges
sw3894B-ms98-a-0042 263.605500 275.561875 okay and my point is hey wait a minute something's wrong here these people are claiming this is the best well if it's the best then it should be translated right on down the line and the general i mean how long has Harvard been around
sw3894B-ms98-a-0043 275.561875 283.698250 okay so ask yourself some questions why don't we have a higher quality with one of the world's great universities Harvard and Stanford both have schools of education
sw3894B-ms98-a-0044 283.698250 291.803000 i mean this is a focus it's not like this isn't an interest of theirs this is a specific focus two of the best funded institutions in the country
sw3894B-ms98-a-0045 291.803000 298.754000 premier universities in the world hey wait a minute how come they can't produce something like MTV which kids want
