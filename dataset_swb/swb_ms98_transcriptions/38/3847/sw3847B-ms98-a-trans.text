sw3847B-ms98-a-0006 24.505250 38.651500 watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automa[tically]- you know naturally as well as have the automatic sprinklers and so it's a lot more rewarding [laughter]

sw3847B-ms98-a-0018 86.670250 92.183750 yeah i- i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before an[d]-
sw3847B-ms98-a-0019 92.183750 103.812250 and it's been real enjoyable although i didn't do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um they'd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would
sw3847B-ms98-a-0020 103.812250 109.973375 come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting [laughter]
sw3847B-ms98-a-0021 109.973375 119.090750 so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so
sw3847B-ms98-a-0022 119.090750 125.522375 um i'm gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that
sw3847B-ms98-a-0023 125.522375 126.932625 you know feels

sw3847B-ms98-a-0036 165.604000 172.069000 yeah yeah i haven't done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a
sw3847B-ms98-a-0037 172.069000 177.592625 a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and
sw3847B-ms98-a-0038 177.592625 189.060750 and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and it's it just grew like crazy but i don't [laughter-have] [laughter-any] [laughter-flowers] on it i don't know how long that takes or if there's anything i need to do differently but
sw3847B-ms98-a-0039 189.060750 192.216500 it's just nice and green right now [laughter]

sw3847B-ms98-a-0041 193.734250 200.871000 uh no i'm thinking white narcissus or something like a pap[er]- white paper flower or something
sw3847B-ms98-a-0042 200.871000 203.517875 and uh so i don't know
sw3847B-ms98-a-0043 203.517875 218.021375 no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we had some 
sw3847B-ms98-a-0044 218.021375 220.085250 some play yard last over but it's
sw3847B-ms98-a-0045 220.085250 230.374500 it's um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you don't have anything else in the backyard that's that's about the size of most of them_1
sw3847B-ms98-a-0046 230.374500 241.202875 so um i guess we're kind of fortunate everyone looks at that with our yar[d]- at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass [laughter-back] [laughter-there]
