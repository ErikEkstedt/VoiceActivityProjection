sw3869A-ms98-a-0002 0.180875 9.643250 obviously there have [laughter-been] [laughter-a] lot of changes in the roles of women over the past couple generations do you do you wanna speak first about your opinions about what those changes have been
sw3869A-ms98-a-0003 9.643250 19.346125 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0004 19.346125 20.729125 yeah

sw3869A-ms98-a-0008 42.449250 47.188250 uh [noise] well i agree with you there i feel that there's
sw3869A-ms98-a-0009 47.188250 51.455000 there's is a turning point a[head]- still ahead of us we haven't gotten there yet
sw3869A-ms98-a-0010 51.455000 52.387250 [noise]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0011 52.387250 54.877625 [noise] excuse me but i do think that
sw3869A-ms98-a-0012 54.877625 64.036000 there is a greater awareness of the the benefits that the the feminine side of people offers you know as well as men you know when you
sw3869A-ms98-a-0013 64.036000 75.165000 when you see some of what's gone on in the self development areas um [laughter-you] [laughter-know] men trying to find their feminine side is is probably something that men uh
sw3869A-ms98-a-0014 75.165000 78.761250 half a generation ago wouldn't have even considered as [laughter-feasible]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0015 78.761250 81.083125 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0016 81.083125 82.393375 um-hum

sw3869A-ms98-a-0021 98.497000 103.662625 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0022 103.662625 106.519750 that's true that is fairly recent
sw3869A-ms98-a-0023 106.519750 117.533250 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0024 117.533250 119.049250 uh-huh
sw3869A-ms98-a-0025 119.049250 131.252875 i f[eel]- i definitely feel that that's true in the political arena it's gonna be a lot longer before women are in positions of au[thority]- authority on a on a majority basis you know there's always gonna be a a few but
sw3869A-ms98-a-0026 131.252875 137.562500 you know whereas in education and in health care women dominate because those are seen as supportive roles
sw3869A-ms98-a-0027 137.562500 147.723375 i think it's interesting to just look at the history of women in h[istory]- in in several cultures to to determine why in Western culture
sw3869A-ms98-a-0028 147.723375 158.805125 they take the role that they do because i[t's]- it's a matriarchial society in a lot of different parts of the world that that puts women in a much stronger position and yet [laughter] in the west it's
sw3869A-ms98-a-0029 158.805125 168.741500 just coming around to the point that we can recognize that the power that that a woman offers to the society you know in terms of nurturing as well as
sw3869A-ms98-a-0030 168.741500 177.008250 [silence]

sw3869A-ms98-a-0037 193.745500 196.727625 uh still a lot of that influence
sw3869A-ms98-a-0038 196.727625 198.825250 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0039 198.825250 201.779750 yes yes and there's so much that's
sw3869A-ms98-a-0040 201.779750 206.092125 um {inculturated} we don't realize in the home how we're 
sw3869A-ms98-a-0041 206.092125 215.393625 how we're influenced i think that even though my parents might've said you know i'm i'm in an area uh health care where there are a lot of women obviously but
sw3869A-ms98-a-0042 215.393625 222.123250 my orientation was never toward being a physician it was toward being a health care provider in another area and
sw3869A-ms98-a-0043 222.123250 236.133375 even though i heard from my my father it certainly go you know pursue as far as you can you can be a physician there was this under lying tone in our home because my mom did not work outside the home that it was also okay to not do that and [laughter-so]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0044 236.133375 245.423750 it's been a challenge to to cope with both of my orientations i- i have a very nurturing side that would in some ways like not to work outside the home
sw3869A-ms98-a-0045 245.423750 246.449000 [laughter]

sw3869A-ms98-a-0049 261.202625 265.580875 yes i think that over time we will recognize what
sw3869A-ms98-a-0050 265.580875 271.786625 our given rights our our given uh gifts are rather th[at]- that are different from men and and it's okay that
sw3869A-ms98-a-0051 271.786625 284.936750 that there are some differences but that there are also a lot more areas that can overlap that that at this point don't i think girls are told that they're probably not gonna be as good at math as as boys are and and they they
sw3869A-ms98-a-0052 284.936750 287.824875 they may be influenced by that in their school work
sw3869A-ms98-a-0053 287.824875 289.328750 [silence]
sw3869A-ms98-a-0054 289.328750 297.584000 i don't know if i was by my by the influence or whether i just am not very oriented in math as i am to [laughter-other] like verbal
