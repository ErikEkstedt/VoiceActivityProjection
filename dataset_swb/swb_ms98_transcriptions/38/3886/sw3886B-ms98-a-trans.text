sw3886B-ms98-a-0003 1.949250 8.601250 well um most of what i do is um listen to the news in the morning when i'm heading to work um
sw3886B-ms98-a-0004 8.601250 21.529750 [noise] we get uh we have two different stations here that run uh National Public Radio and i really enjoy the format in the morning and the evening when i'm driving home from work so that's where i get most of my stuff uh
sw3886B-ms98-a-0005 21.529750 28.058625 yeah we we also subscribe to the newspaper of course so we get the Washington Post here and it's a pretty interesting newspaper
sw3886B-ms98-a-0006 28.058625 38.206500 and uh so it's you know it's it's uh between the two i generally do okay every great once in a while i manage to uh listen to the evening news but not very often how about_1
sw3886B-ms98-a-0007 38.206500 44.478625 [silence]
sw3886B-ms98-a-0008 44.478625 47.370375 yeah i don't blame you it's it's uh it's
sw3886B-ms98-a-0009 47.370375 50.640000 [silence]
sw3886B-ms98-a-0010 50.640000 52.076625 yeah and it actually
sw3886B-ms98-a-0011 52.076625 66.147750 well no i it's i guess what is it it's um it's kind of a talk radio station it's run by a university here called American University or at least that the the general program that i listen to National Public Radio itself is um
sw3886B-ms98-a-0012 66.147750 78.273125 a uh uh a syndicated thing that's run by a group that operates here in Washington uh but if you have any public radio stations in your area chances are pretty good
sw3886B-ms98-a-0013 78.273125 84.141750 especially in Austin come to think of it uh that you're going to be able to get it down there uh
sw3886B-ms98-a-0014 84.141750 85.539375 [silence]
sw3886B-ms98-a-0015 85.539375 86.821500 yeah
sw3886B-ms98-a-0016 86.821500 88.232375 [silence]
sw3886B-ms98-a-0017 88.232375 98.304625 well i don't know whatever your you know it it the normally the public radio stations are gonna be down at the low end of the dial you know around eighty eight and uh and so forth and and uh
sw3886B-ms98-a-0018 98.304625 106.899875 this uh the two radio stations that run here one is a classical station and the other i guess if you had to categorize it's kind of a bluegrass station or something
sw3886B-ms98-a-0019 106.899875 118.519500 um but uh yeah that that's i'm i'm dead certain some station in your area carries it because every once in a while they'll do little special features on Austin it's a real interesting radio program because they they don't just co[ver]-

sw3886B-ms98-a-0027 134.476625 139.524875 um -[w]ell that's very interesting well this comes on right in the evening as i'm driving home
sw3886B-ms98-a-0028 139.524875 153.794500 and um what they do is they they give you uh about a five to ten minute news uh broadcast and then for the rest of the half hour they usually divide it up into two or three segments where they they cover
sw3886B-ms98-a-0029 153.794500 168.759875 um topics either of current interest or every once in a while they'll just do kind of an indepth reporting on on some uh particular thing like yeah like per[haps]- for instance how a particular city is doing or something along those lines yeah it's uh
sw3886B-ms98-a-0030 168.759875 177.902625 yeah it's real good and it [noise] it it uh the other thing is is i[s]- my politics are kind of liberal and and um so they have a tendency being public radio to 
sw3886B-ms98-a-0031 177.902625 187.911625 sort of take a look at things from the populist point of view as opposed to being terribly sympathetic to the government although the you you've got to give them_1 credit they do a great job of showing both sides of the story
sw3886B-ms98-a-0032 187.911625 191.342750 and uh they aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves either
sw3886B-ms98-a-0033 191.342750 198.554125 which is [laughter-something] [laughter-i] [laughter-really] admire so if you watch the evening news which of the news commentators do you tend to like the most
sw3886B-ms98-a-0034 198.554125 210.766375 [silence]
sw3886B-ms98-a-0035 210.766375 224.270750 yeah yeah i'm the same way but the the evening news on TV it's it's really it's so short that you just uh i don't feel like you wind up getting enough and yet have you ever watched the uh McNeil Lehrer report on public TV
sw3886B-ms98-a-0036 224.270750 228.356250 i sort of feel like that news program drags on too long
sw3886B-ms98-a-0037 228.356250 239.530750 and uh wi[th]- you know with their little round table discussions and all that sort of stuff and i must admit i i used to try to watch it u[sed]- used to make me feel like oh well this is uh something i should be watching
sw3886B-ms98-a-0038 239.530750 241.895500 [laughter] [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
