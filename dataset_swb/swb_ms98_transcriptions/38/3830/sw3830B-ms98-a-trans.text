sw3830B-ms98-a-0032 113.774375 116.761625 i think today the thing that i uh
sw3830B-ms98-a-0033 116.761625 124.123000 would appreciate the most uh because my husband gets his medical through his company but we have to pay for mine
sw3830B-ms98-a-0034 124.123000 127.496500 and we're the only one that i'm the only one that's being insured
sw3830B-ms98-a-0035 127.496500 137.648125 and and we pay the same amount that someone over there that has four children have i mean [laughter-so] [laughter-it's] [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] and i would i really and the way medical expenses are
sw3830B-ms98-a-0036 137.648125 143.449375 i think that's probably one of the biggest benefits to ha[ve]- you need to have
sw3830B-ms98-a-0037 143.449375 145.073500 right
sw3830B-ms98-a-0038 145.073500 157.946625 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0039 157.946625 161.654625 it's out of sight right it's out of sight
sw3830B-ms98-a-0040 161.654625 165.809000 even at a group rate i couldn't believe how much is our
sw3830B-ms98-a-0041 165.809000 172.162375 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0042 172.162375 175.296750 right it goes up right
sw3830B-ms98-a-0043 175.296750 186.802625 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0044 186.802625 188.271000 um-hum

sw3830B-ms98-a-0050 208.141500 216.976875 right it's going to hurt the city although uh i will personally tell you i used to work at a bank and i would see the GM people come in when they were they would shut down to retool
sw3830B-ms98-a-0051 216.976875 221.305875 they were paid that whole time and i don't know if you're aware of this ri[ght]- yes
sw3830B-ms98-a-0052 221.305875 224.726125 they come in there just they go off fishing and stuff and come in and
sw3830B-ms98-a-0053 224.726125 234.374625 every Friday and go to the safety deposit box and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week you know and they had all these gr[eat]- i- i really believe they have done this to themselves [noise]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0054 234.374625 237.323875 in a way because of the unions being so strong
sw3830B-ms98-a-0055 237.323875 242.674875 and right now anybody that's laid off from GM will have a full year's paycheck
sw3830B-ms98-a-0056 242.674875 251.100750 i just read this in the paper the other day plus probably an additional six months through the the worker's stuff that they have at
sw3830B-ms98-a-0057 251.100750 262.483500 at uh through the company so i'm so[rry]- you know i'm sorry it's happening because it's going to hurt but i don't feel as sorry for them if my husband were laid off tomorrow we'd get one more check and that would be it
sw3830B-ms98-a-0058 262.483500 266.391125 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0059 266.391125 270.050625 yes oh yeah that's already hurting yeah
sw3830B-ms98-a-0060 270.050625 271.899375 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0061 271.899375 283.357625 but i think there's a case where benefits have gotten they voted them_1 in and they got so good i mean like two dollars for a prescription no deductible on the medical all these things you know
sw3830B-ms98-a-0062 283.357625 287.281000 and it made the prices of cars go up and
sw3830B-ms98-a-0063 287.281000 291.828750 and you know the i we i believe in unions but they went too far
sw3830B-ms98-a-0064 291.828750 293.079125 [silence]
sw3830B-ms98-a-0065 293.079125 296.248375 i mean i can't make eighteen dollars an hour
sw3830B-ms98-a-0066 296.248375 299.522000 i mean i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour
