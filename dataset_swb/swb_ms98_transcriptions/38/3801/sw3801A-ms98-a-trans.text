sw3801A-ms98-a-0037 167.710000 169.405500 [silence]
sw3801A-ms98-a-0038 169.405500 170.565375 it's kind of
sw3801A-ms98-a-0039 170.565375 172.805250 kind of stupid isn't it
sw3801A-ms98-a-0040 172.805250 181.535625 but i guess when people do those things they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time it's looks like easy pickings and away you go right

sw3801A-ms98-a-0048 207.498875 212.733375 i think when you have haves and have nots you're always going to find people that are
sw3801A-ms98-a-0049 212.733375 223.287625 too lazy to figure a way to earn money and find it's easier if you can get a gun to go out and hold something up than it is to figure out a way to legitimately earn the money
