sw3892A-ms98-a-0029 89.288375 97.922250 oh i think i learned how to do that when i was real young too um one thing i'd kind of like to learn how to do is um quilt
sw3892A-ms98-a-0030 97.922250 108.608375 um i see so many beautiful quilts and i have friends that that make them_1 but you know there's just seems like there's not that amount of time nowadays
sw3892A-ms98-a-0031 108.608375 112.358500 you know because i work full-time outside the home

sw3892A-ms98-a-0040 154.567250 162.353875 yeah i think that's true um like some people make uh um decorating their house a hobby
sw3892A-ms98-a-0041 162.353875 169.170125 and i have a friend who she and i both got into our houses around the same time and she's real she has a knack for that
sw3892A-ms98-a-0042 169.170125 177.529125 you know she made her own curtains and and i would love to be able to do all of that but i don't feel that i have quite the knack that she does
sw3892A-ms98-a-0043 177.529125 185.272500 and so uh you know we're thinking of hiring a decorator and stuff and i sometimes feel like you know that's a cop out but yet
sw3892A-ms98-a-0044 185.272500 196.428500 if if i- i don't want to spend all the time and money and not and then feel like it looks real cheaply done or or you know not be satisfied with it
sw3892A-ms98-a-0045 196.428500 205.641125 but um my mother had that same knack you know for decorating and and it probably just comes with with [laughter-age] and with years of ex[perience]- you know
