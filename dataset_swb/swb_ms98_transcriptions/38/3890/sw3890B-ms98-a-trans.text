sw3890B-ms98-a-0020 71.786375 81.417875 of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a [laughter-car] or something and uh
sw3890B-ms98-a-0021 81.417875 94.491625 yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they they're they're holding on but it's not it's not going to be a [noise] a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA

sw3890B-ms98-a-0030 128.536875 133.671000 but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup [noise]
sw3890B-ms98-a-0031 133.671000 142.773875 you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they [noise] it wasn't a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then
sw3890B-ms98-a-0032 142.773875 152.539875 and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to [laughter-play] which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so

sw3890B-ms98-a-0035 164.343500 175.588375 and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition
sw3890B-ms98-a-0036 175.588375 185.184000 and then it it kind of went downhill for about_1 for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but
