sw3855B-ms98-a-0003 2.247250 3.661125 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0004 3.661125 5.571125 oh we use them
sw3855B-ms98-a-0005 5.571125 7.683500 for paying our gas
sw3855B-ms98-a-0006 7.683500 9.022125 for paying
sw3855B-ms98-a-0007 9.022125 16.144375 uh just about anything because um we don't like to pay for our checks [laughter] so we use it quite a bit
sw3855B-ms98-a-0008 16.144375 24.725750 but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards
sw3855B-ms98-a-0009 24.725750 32.459000 if there's a monthly or a yearly charge we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free so we never have to pay anything extra
sw3855B-ms98-a-0010 32.459000 36.111750 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0011 36.111750 38.523000 yeah we just don't think it's worth it
sw3855B-ms98-a-0012 38.523000 39.545375 so
sw3855B-ms98-a-0013 39.545375 47.342875 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0014 47.342875 48.380875 uh-huh
sw3855B-ms98-a-0015 48.380875 59.607500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0016 59.607500 62.648375 see well you i don't do it either [laughter]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0017 62.648375 67.031625 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0018 67.031625 68.350500 yeah
sw3855B-ms98-a-0019 68.350500 74.322875 yes exactly that's how i f[eel]- i mean it's a rare day when i even have seventy five cents in my purse
sw3855B-ms98-a-0020 74.322875 75.530000 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0021 75.530000 76.593500 yeah
sw3855B-ms98-a-0022 76.593500 86.499750 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0023 86.499750 88.879000 [laughter]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0024 88.879000 97.889250 yeah because it's really it helps your if you have good credit you know it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a bigger purchase or something
sw3855B-ms98-a-0025 97.889250 104.564500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0026 104.564500 115.888875 yeah and i think it's more convenient too in a lot of cases like whenever we go on trips we always you know use our our Visa or our MasterCard or whatever
sw3855B-ms98-a-0027 115.888875 123.054250 and then um you know we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later
sw3855B-ms98-a-0028 123.054250 133.801875 and so it helps us gain interest in the bank that when we do it we come out a l[ittle]- even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever first off and then pay for it later
sw3855B-ms98-a-0029 133.801875 141.457250 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0030 141.457250 142.908750 oh yeah
sw3855B-ms98-a-0031 142.908750 145.840375 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0032 145.840375 148.327000 yeah even if it's five bucks even
sw3855B-ms98-a-0033 148.327000 156.501000 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0034 156.501000 157.951625 yeah
sw3855B-ms98-a-0035 157.951625 168.823250 and also if you if someone did happen to steal your credit card my husband was saying that if you know you notice it within i think it's twenty four hours you can report it in
sw3855B-ms98-a-0036 168.823250 180.603250 and i he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel you know whatever payments you had and and if whoever tried to uh you know credit it to the hilt 
sw3855B-ms98-a-0037 180.603250 183.787125 you'd only have to pay fifty dollars of it and then
sw3855B-ms98-a-0038 183.787125 186.247500 you know you can have your card back with
sw3855B-ms98-a-0039 186.247500 191.463000 pretty good rating you know because you can pay fifty dollars but not you know maybe five thousand or whatever
sw3855B-ms98-a-0040 191.463000 195.763750 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0041 195.763750 197.038250 i know
sw3855B-ms98-a-0042 197.038250 204.932500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0043 204.932500 206.803500 yeah exactly
sw3855B-ms98-a-0044 206.803500 212.299500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0045 212.299500 216.884625 yeah sure i mean it's just a precaution for everybody
sw3855B-ms98-a-0046 216.884625 217.921500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0047 217.921500 219.410375 yeah so
sw3855B-ms98-a-0048 219.410375 223.259000 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0049 223.259000 224.296625 um
sw3855B-ms98-a-0050 224.296625 226.925500 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0051 226.925500 235.336375 oh i also use like to use Discover when i can because uh you know they give you some money back every year 
sw3855B-ms98-a-0052 235.336375 237.982000 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0053 237.982000 239.888250 yeah yeah
sw3855B-ms98-a-0054 239.888250 241.634375 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0055 241.634375 244.595625 well we just started doing that and
sw3855B-ms98-a-0056 244.595625 252.364625 you know what it comes in handy is for when you're buying things like um tickets for the train or um airplanes 
sw3855B-ms98-a-0057 252.364625 260.048500 because they'll give you some money back you know and it's only a little bit but i mean it's still something we got two fifty last year
sw3855B-ms98-a-0058 260.048500 263.375375 and so it's you know it helps out here and there
sw3855B-ms98-a-0059 263.375375 264.629125 so
sw3855B-ms98-a-0060 264.629125 268.133625 [silence]
sw3855B-ms98-a-0061 268.133625 278.809875 yeah they give you i think they start giving you like a half a percent back which doesn't sound like a thing but when you you know when you add up everything you've you've charged up on the Discover card for a year
sw3855B-ms98-a-0062 278.809875 283.877750 and they give you a half percent of that and that adds up to you know two fifty or something
sw3855B-ms98-a-0063 283.877750 285.694125 and so that's what
sw3855B-ms98-a-0064 285.694125 288.955750 and i know we're going to get back more this year because they
sw3855B-ms98-a-0065 288.955750 291.114625 you know we spent a little bit more
sw3855B-ms98-a-0066 291.114625 295.797625 probably and they do it for how long you've been a member i think too
sw3855B-ms98-a-0067 295.797625 298.224750 and they increase the percentage a little bit
sw3855B-ms98-a-0068 298.224750 299.234000 [silence]
