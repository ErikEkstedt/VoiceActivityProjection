sw3852A-ms98-a-0021 90.198000 92.578000 [silence]

sw3852A-ms98-a-0025 98.399875 111.638750 [silence]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0026 111.638750 113.389125 my goodness
sw3852A-ms98-a-0027 113.389125 114.549375 [laughter]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0028 114.549375 116.254375 [silence]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0029 116.254375 120.386750 i would think so [laughter-that] doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one
sw3852A-ms98-a-0030 120.386750 135.348375 well i'm relatively fortunate about that uh here we somehow don't have many people run into us although at the beginning of each school season uh students move into town who are from big cities
sw3852A-ms98-a-0031 135.348375 147.767375 and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two three weeks then they finally settle down and realize that they don't have to drive that way here and uh that takes the strain out off of everyone that uh is driving a vehicle
sw3852A-ms98-a-0032 147.767375 158.257125 and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to uh take care of us in the winter time
sw3852A-ms98-a-0033 158.257125 168.236375 uh i have a sixty nine Cougar and a seventy seven Pontiac so forth and i have to uh and i drive a Honda most of the time
sw3852A-ms98-a-0034 168.236375 178.825000 and i have to make sure that uh salt and so forth are kept off of it and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it because it's rusted away
sw3852A-ms98-a-0035 178.825000 184.744875 [silence]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0036 184.744875 186.294500 uh-huh
sw3852A-ms98-a-0037 186.294500 195.695000 well i just i di[d]- i had this Cougar totally uh the body of it totally rebuilt uh to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders
sw3852A-ms98-a-0038 195.695000 206.286125 uh done and then it all repainted and then [laughter] winter got here and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off so i haven't had a chance to drive it very much [laughter]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0039 206.286125 211.522625 but anyhow uh uh now are you gonna buy this next car or you going rent it a lease again
sw3852A-ms98-a-0040 211.522625 214.683625 [silence]

sw3852A-ms98-a-0044 225.129875 235.311500 [silence]
sw3852A-ms98-a-0045 235.311500 242.812875 well that's an awfully big one that uh that one that you had the Lincoln uh isn't it too large for normal town driving
sw3852A-ms98-a-0046 242.812875 246.206500 finding parking places and getting in and out the doors
sw3852A-ms98-a-0047 246.206500 247.718625 uh-huh
sw3852A-ms98-a-0048 247.718625 254.959875 [silence]

sw3852A-ms98-a-0052 260.124625 265.383875 w[ell]- well that certainly would be a wonderful comfortable machine to take on long trips
sw3852A-ms98-a-0053 265.383875 267.659750 i'm i'm very much aware of that
sw3852A-ms98-a-0054 267.659750 268.676500 [silence]

sw3852A-ms98-a-0057 273.358000 285.315750 yes i'm sure it is because that's the way that i enjoy this Pontiac that i have it only has thirty eight thousand miles on it but it's very quiet and very smooth riding machine
sw3852A-ms98-a-0058 285.315750 295.739250 [silence]
