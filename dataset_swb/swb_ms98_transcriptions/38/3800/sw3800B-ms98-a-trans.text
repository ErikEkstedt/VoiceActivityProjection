sw3800B-ms98-a-0002 0.694500 14.473125 uh yes uh uh not as much as i used to we used to have quite a few credit cards and over the the last few years we've tried to cut them back a little [laughter-bit] and and uh down to m[ainly]- mainly one each uh
sw3800B-ms98-a-0003 14.473125 18.695000 uh it's it's easy to let them_1 get out of control
sw3800B-ms98-a-0004 18.695000 28.494625 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0005 28.494625 30.985500 oh [vocalized-noise] [laughter]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0006 30.985500 35.996750 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0007 35.996750 46.212125 yeah yeah that's uh that's what we try to to go to uh and eliminate all the uh uh department store uh credit cards uh got rid of all those
sw3800B-ms98-a-0008 46.212125 52.497875 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0009 52.497875 65.989750 yes they they uh they used to be uh uh more credit conscious i think the credit card companies now with with interest rates as high as they are they don't have to be as credit conscious they can
sw3800B-ms98-a-0010 65.989750 68.970000 yeah they can write off a lot more losses now
sw3800B-ms98-a-0011 68.970000 77.987625 uh which which i kind of disagree uh with i'd rather them_1 going back to being a little bit more credit conscious and and lower the rates
sw3800B-ms98-a-0012 77.987625 90.998625 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0013 90.998625 101.268375 yeah i i've heard though that the ones who are offering the lower rates uh do have tougher credit checks and than the ones with the higher rates have
sw3800B-ms98-a-0014 101.268375 104.474750 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0015 104.474750 105.980750 yeah
sw3800B-ms98-a-0016 105.980750 113.994500 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0017 113.994500 115.770125 yeah [noise]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0018 115.770125 126.482375 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0019 126.482375 127.797750 yeah
sw3800B-ms98-a-0020 127.797750 130.491125 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0021 130.491125 132.621000 we[ll]- yeah
sw3800B-ms98-a-0022 132.621000 147.497750 well well peop[le]- people shop real heavily for when they for savings accounts and everything else to get that extra percent or two and then they don't look at at spending uh eighteen percent [laughter] on on credit it's uh for some reason they don't look at it that way
sw3800B-ms98-a-0023 147.497750 153.689375 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0024 153.689375 155.000375 that
sw3800B-ms98-a-0025 155.000375 156.768000 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0026 156.768000 165.284250 that's that's true we we have tried uh in the last couple years to to do just that and use them for convenience and pay them_1 off but there's
sw3800B-ms98-a-0027 165.284250 171.993375 sometimes around Christmas and times like that we sometimes charge up a bit and takes a couple months to pay them_1 off but
sw3800B-ms98-a-0028 171.993375 182.449875 but the people who who can't afford it uh they really get caught up in in the minimum payment and the interest rate it it's sort of like the federal government [laughter]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0029 182.449875 196.994500 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0030 196.994500 198.998750 yes that's right
sw3800B-ms98-a-0031 198.998750 201.986625 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0032 201.986625 207.660625 well the credit card companies i know are arguing against uh being forced to lower their rates but uh
sw3800B-ms98-a-0033 207.660625 218.176375 uh i think it would only mean that they'd they'd have to go back and and toughen their requirements a a bit and they'd probably make just as much money they just wouldn't write off as many losses
sw3800B-ms98-a-0034 218.176375 230.983375 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0035 230.983375 233.475000 yeah that's that's right
sw3800B-ms98-a-0036 233.475000 237.488125 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0037 237.488125 238.997000 yes uh
sw3800B-ms98-a-0038 238.997000 239.997000 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0039 239.997000 252.735125 well like in like in any business they uh the same thing happened to banks you know they didn't look at uh the credit worthiness of making a lot of loans either and that's in uh in real estate and other things and it's the same with credit cards
sw3800B-ms98-a-0040 252.735125 259.499250 [silence]
sw3800B-ms98-a-0041 259.499250 265.489500 yeah we i- i use a company one somewhat uh uh t[o]- to uh
sw3800B-ms98-a-0042 265.489500 275.701625 do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because_1 i'm responsible for the interest on that one if [laughter] if i don't pay it off uh uh
sw3800B-ms98-a-0043 275.701625 287.962375 i work for uh an oil company and they they issue a an American Express card so that you don't have to ask for uh expense advances when you have to travel and buy air tickets so
sw3800B-ms98-a-0044 287.962375 298.306000 so you just use your card but it's but it's in your name so it's up to you to pay it off and and because it's American Express you can't run up a a credit on it so that
