sw3800A-ms98-a-0022 81.988125 93.496250 well i can't see why people if they shop around you can find uh you know thirteen fourteen percent rates without any problem i can't imagine why anyone would even think about paying nineteen you know because_1 the[re's]-

sw3800A-ms98-a-0025 105.473375 119.235625 you know it there's a lot of people you know i that uh you know you receive all those ones in the mail and it just seems like well we s[ent]- we'll take it just because they sent it to me and then they get charged fifty dollars c[ost]- or a year for the just the fee and everything it
sw3800A-ms98-a-0026 119.235625 123.040000 i don't know i just i have a hard time i like i say i
sw3800A-ms98-a-0027 123.040000 134.239125 working in a financial institution i just i'm really rate conscious i guess and can't see paying you know hardly or near that much twenty one percent gets pretty crazy

sw3800A-ms98-a-0033 146.991250 158.975375 yep there's i imagine there's there's quite a few people who just pay it off monthly so they don't have to ch[arge]- you know get get charged any but it seems like the people that can least afford it are the ones of course that can't pay it off monthly and get

sw3800A-ms98-a-0044 184.982250 193.276500 yeah i uh i- i think that would do the whole country a lot of good is a lot of you know consumers paying down some of that debt they've got it just seems like they're
sw3800A-ms98-a-0045 193.276500 202.484000 they right now they can't afford to buy anymore because they're up to the limits in debt and and everything and so you know that's part of the reason i think everything's kind of stalled out but

sw3800A-ms98-a-0052 228.469375 242.949625 pick things up but it would just it do wouldn't do any good because you know the banks aren't stupid they're going to realize that they can't you know they can't keep affording to write off five percent if they're only charging you know thirteen fourteen percent
