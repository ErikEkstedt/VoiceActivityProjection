sw3895B-ms98-a-0033 184.103500 189.284875 and so now all our outdoor activities are centered around the lake house

sw3895B-ms98-a-0043 241.377500 251.245375 [silence]
sw3895B-ms98-a-0044 251.245375 257.658625 i bet Yellowstone was a neat place to camp in we we went up we pulled a trailer out there from Illinois um
sw3895B-ms98-a-0045 257.658625 265.941750 when uh probably about nineteen seventy four i'm tr[ying]- no no no no it was before that it was must have been nineteen seventy two before we moved to Texas
sw3895B-ms98-a-0046 265.941750 272.368500 and uh we had like a sixteen foot trailer that uh we pulled behind the car
sw3895B-ms98-a-0047 272.368500 280.902000 and all the kids and the dog and everything and actually i- i think i liked the camping with the tent better than pulling the trailer
sw3895B-ms98-a-0048 280.902000 286.083750 but we made it out to Yellowstone and it was gorgeous never forget that
sw3895B-ms98-a-0049 286.083750 289.557500 [silence]
sw3895B-ms98-a-0050 289.557500 299.074000 yeah it was and uh we needless to say we ha[ven't]- we haven't done it [laughter-again] [laughter] pulling the trailer is not the our favorite thing to do
