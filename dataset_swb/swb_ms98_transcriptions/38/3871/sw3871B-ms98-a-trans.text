sw3871B-ms98-a-0002 1.030875 2.523500 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0003 2.523500 10.914250 well it's uh certainly would would help things out uh i don't see a terribly lot of it going on uh here
sw3871B-ms98-a-0004 10.914250 11.944000 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0005 11.944000 17.963625 i was actually quite surprised i went to uh San Francisco recently uh to Berkeley and and uh
sw3871B-ms98-a-0006 17.963625 31.771375 they actually have mandatory re[cycling]- well no theirs theirs is not mandatory i'm sorry uh but you know it was just incredible to see [laughter] everybody with you know with with ten bags of things and they and they have a community recycling center uh where
sw3871B-ms98-a-0007 31.771375 44.111625 rather than than having monetary incentives for the for the people that actually bring stuff into recycling they're just doing it to help out the city and then the city can use that money you know any money that they can get from that goods that are recycled
sw3871B-ms98-a-0008 44.111625 48.143125 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0009 48.143125 56.646375 yeah no i would i would be glad to but you know we have no place convenient at all i mean i am not really concerned about making money off of it um
sw3871B-ms98-a-0010 56.646375 62.121750 [laughter-you] [laughter-know] i mean that that the amount of money that would come out of it is not not enough to make it worthwhile
sw3871B-ms98-a-0011 62.121750 70.079750 it's just the recycling per se but uh we do very little uh recycle newspapers [laughter] but other than that
sw3871B-ms98-a-0012 70.079750 72.428125 kind of a shame
sw3871B-ms98-a-0013 72.428125 91.569625 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0014 91.569625 93.396250 um-hum um-hum
sw3871B-ms98-a-0015 93.396250 95.058875 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0016 95.058875 96.312125 um-hum
sw3871B-ms98-a-0017 96.312125 100.818625 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0018 100.818625 102.359875 right
sw3871B-ms98-a-0019 102.359875 105.296875 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0020 105.296875 118.307000 yeah i- i- i think you know i think that if they would have sort of neighborhood or or semi neighborhood recycling centers that is what i saw in Berkeley was it was real interesting it just had uh bunches of bins and and uh
sw3871B-ms98-a-0021 118.307000 132.142125 in diff[erent]- [vocalized-noise] in each for different things uh uh you know they even had a spe[cific]- specific of course being in wine country they they even had wine bottle recycling so you take the wine bottles and the the the wineries would actually buy you know take those bottles back directly
sw3871B-ms98-a-0022 132.142125 141.848375 yeah not and not to have to melt them down they just reuse them_1 uh but they had things for for different types of paper and they had things for the aluminum and then for plastics and
sw3871B-ms98-a-0023 141.848375 155.159000 apparently yeah there there you know there is only a matter of maybe ten fifteen blocks away from where these friend of my lived and and they just save everything up and took a trip over there and they they didn't get anything for it but but um
sw3871B-ms98-a-0024 155.159000 163.333625 you know the thing is that that a center like that i am sure it would be self supporting if uh you know just off the the proceeds from from recycled things
sw3871B-ms98-a-0025 163.333625 167.026000 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0026 167.026000 173.185250 yeah that's what i am saying you know they could pay for if they you know if they have to have somebody there occasionally to kind of keep an eye on things or do stuff
sw3871B-ms98-a-0027 173.185250 179.871500 you know that that salary could easily be paid out of the money that comes from uh selling the glass or or aluminum or whatever
sw3871B-ms98-a-0028 179.871500 190.866125 and uh you know they even had uh they even had a little little shelf area for recycled books where people brought books they didn't want put them on the shelf and p[eople]- anybo[dy]- you just come and take anything you wanted off the shelf and 
sw3871B-ms98-a-0029 190.866125 193.724875 it was uh it was quite a [noise] quite an operation
sw3871B-ms98-a-0030 193.724875 195.885250 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0031 195.885250 197.134500 yeah
sw3871B-ms98-a-0032 197.134500 198.309625 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0033 198.309625 201.163250 no no it's
sw3871B-ms98-a-0034 201.163250 208.375125 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0035 208.375125 209.713000 um-hum
sw3871B-ms98-a-0036 209.713000 217.103000 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0037 217.103000 218.680125 yeah
sw3871B-ms98-a-0038 218.680125 221.920250 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0039 221.920250 231.646625 oh oh i haven't seen those now i- i- i think i have seen them_1 actually going with like a sack on the side where they are picking up aluminum cans people put them out separately
sw3871B-ms98-a-0040 231.646625 235.902625 and they'll they'll toss those in a in a bag on the side of the truck or something but
sw3871B-ms98-a-0041 235.902625 245.343500 hm yeah i- i- i think that that there's a little bit of you know of of you know i think that they the emphasis on making money from recycling 
sw3871B-ms98-a-0042 245.343500 256.885125 is is a is a little bit wrong you know certainly there's mon[ey]- you know -[i]t's valuable to somebody but i think that the average consumer probably doesn't want to spend the time and it is not enough money to make it really interesting anyway and so
sw3871B-ms98-a-0043 256.885125 265.785500 um you know i think they they ought to make more of an emphasis on on convenience as opposed to to uh you know to trying to give people money for it
sw3871B-ms98-a-0044 265.785500 271.609375 [silence]
sw3871B-ms98-a-0045 271.609375 281.990125 oh now that we do we where i work we we recycle the cans and bottles and and paper but there's a lot of computer paper generated so it's you know generally clean white paper
sw3871B-ms98-a-0046 281.990125 283.646625 and uh
sw3871B-ms98-a-0047 283.646625 292.289750 [silence]
