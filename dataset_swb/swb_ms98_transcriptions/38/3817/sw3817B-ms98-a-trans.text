sw3817B-ms98-a-0003 1.959625 8.224125 the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago

sw3817B-ms98-a-0005 9.894250 28.348750 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0006 28.348750 36.855875 it often depends how far you want to go back o[n]- on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather
sw3817B-ms98-a-0007 36.855875 48.944000 so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didn't know i think the total participation i don't know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there
sw3817B-ms98-a-0008 48.944000 59.312250 and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the f[amilies]- families did was to get T-shirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family
sw3817B-ms98-a-0009 59.312250 60.933625 it was fun
sw3817B-ms98-a-0010 60.933625 65.831625 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0011 65.831625 77.914625 [noise] actually he was not he has gone [laughter] but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldn't just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess
sw3817B-ms98-a-0012 77.914625 80.302500 whatever fifth and seventh cousins
sw3817B-ms98-a-0013 80.302500 92.997750 and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and
sw3817B-ms98-a-0014 92.997750 94.627375 so that was fun
sw3817B-ms98-a-0015 94.627375 99.996125 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0016 99.996125 110.224875 you know in every family there's usually one person that is gifted to do these things [laughter] i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel
sw3817B-ms98-a-0017 110.224875 117.506500 um and she did she was she's always been interested in genealogy and she's kind of kept track [noise] and so
sw3817B-ms98-a-0018 117.506500 119.555000 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0019 119.555000 124.510000 [noise] um i think she just started out writing to
sw3817B-ms98-a-0020 124.510000 136.761625 key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really [vocalized-noise] on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost 
sw3817B-ms98-a-0021 136.761625 143.106250 in Missouri but this is was in Indiana [noise] and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area
sw3817B-ms98-a-0022 143.106250 147.873250 so it wasn't like they were necessarily from all over the country but
sw3817B-ms98-a-0023 147.873250 154.064250 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0024 154.064250 157.676125 [noise] we're a good Catholic German stock and so yes
sw3817B-ms98-a-0025 157.676125 165.001000 the original family that i eluded to my great-grandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of th[at]- that was another thing they did that i thought was fun
sw3817B-ms98-a-0026 165.001000 168.897125 [noise] sounds like the [trelve/twelve] twelve tribes of Israel or something
sw3817B-ms98-a-0027 168.897125 173.422125 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0028 173.422125 182.970875 that's always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion

sw3817B-ms98-a-0039 232.505375 234.540375 [noise] typical [laughter]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0040 234.540375 237.136250 [silence]

sw3817B-ms98-a-0046 261.737750 271.565625 so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i don't know that's the American way
sw3817B-ms98-a-0047 271.565625 276.059500 [silence]
sw3817B-ms98-a-0048 276.059500 287.095500 [noise] i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area [laughter] th[at]- that i never had met and didn't know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived
sw3817B-ms98-a-0049 287.095500 291.843875 ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them it's like my f[ather]-
sw3817B-ms98-a-0050 291.843875 299.522000 i don't remember how this was i guess it was actually just my father's cousin so it's not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so
