sw3864A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.090000 that's that's a timely kind of a question isn't it 
sw3864A-ms98-a-0002 3.090000 6.827625 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0003 6.827625 13.785375 i really don't think that i would consider them a threat any longer and i suppose that's primarily because
sw3864A-ms98-a-0004 13.785375 19.476750 their economy really won't allow them to uh expend a lot of
sw3864A-ms98-a-0005 19.476750 24.845625 resources on on war um if that were their primary concern
sw3864A-ms98-a-0006 24.845625 28.280625 and it'll be a while before they're an economic threat for sure
sw3864A-ms98-a-0007 28.280625 38.179875 [silence]

sw3864A-ms98-a-0010 47.740375 57.518500 [noise] do you think that if their economy were in a better condition that they would be a threat uh that given their political changes they would still be a threat or
sw3864A-ms98-a-0011 57.518500 65.152375 [silence]

sw3864A-ms98-a-0015 74.180875 79.613250 there there've been such drastic changes in their political orientation that it's
sw3864A-ms98-a-0016 79.613250 89.012000 hard to predict what it will look like in fifty years but certainly so far what we've seen [laughter-is] a turn around from where things were fifty years ago
sw3864A-ms98-a-0017 89.012000 91.512625 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0018 91.512625 94.552875 no no and yourself

sw3864A-ms98-a-0028 131.584125 142.368000 yes yeah their problems are definitely at this point economic it it seems that the whole infrastructure is focused on you know organizational um
sw3864A-ms98-a-0029 142.368000 143.421750 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0030 143.421750 151.776625 skimming [laughter-off] the top you know especially the government but um it's gonna be awhile before the people adopt the philosophy that
sw3864A-ms98-a-0031 151.776625 156.748250 if you work harder you can also benefit personally and that
sw3864A-ms98-a-0032 156.748250 169.594375 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0033 169.594375 171.006375 um-hum

sw3864A-ms98-a-0037 185.252750 196.573750 and and almost um the philosophy has been put in as little as you can because you know that the same results will will be there at the end so [laughter-why] spend the extra energy
sw3864A-ms98-a-0038 196.573750 201.678125 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0039 201.678125 203.047750 uh-huh

sw3864A-ms98-a-0042 208.678500 213.520250 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0043 213.520250 219.402000 i wonder too if their thinking hasn't been so influenced over the years that the Western way is bad that
sw3864A-ms98-a-0044 219.402000 227.466125 it would it's hard for them to look at some of the Western market place strategies as being good because they've been
sw3864A-ms98-a-0045 227.466125 229.007125 [noise]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0046 229.007125 232.300625 propagandized the other direction for so long
sw3864A-ms98-a-0047 232.300625 239.078750 [silence]
sw3864A-ms98-a-0048 239.078750 244.715375 i think that they're one economy that i feel that that's worth the investment you know there are some
sw3864A-ms98-a-0049 244.715375 253.311000 um places in the world where i'm not sure that the money that the United States is putting in is really getting the kind of return that that's gonna benefit both parties but
sw3864A-ms98-a-0050 253.311000 261.033125 um it seems that there's such an effort to make it work there that what they really do need is is the loans and the
sw3864A-ms98-a-0051 261.033125 271.717875 uh strategic assistance from other countries i'll i'll be curious to see what happens in this elections because it doesn't seem as though that's forth coming right now um
sw3864A-ms98-a-0052 271.717875 273.241250 that
sw3864A-ms98-a-0053 273.241250 278.652250 yeah i think well i was watching something the other day a news program that that indicated um
sw3864A-ms98-a-0054 278.652250 282.597375 the concern on Bush's part is that if he puts
sw3864A-ms98-a-0055 282.597375 293.698000 great interest in that area now he's gonna be accused of not spending enough time on the domestic issues you know certainly foreign issues are his strength [laughter] so it's a catch twenty two [laughter]
