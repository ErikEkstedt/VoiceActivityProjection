sw3870B-ms98-a-0002 1.114125 6.782125 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0003 6.782125 19.831625 [vocalized-noise] well i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately uh the invisible hand that which Adam Smith wrote
sw3870B-ms98-a-0004 19.831625 25.896375 has uh provided some very good health care and uh much
sw3870B-ms98-a-0005 25.896375 33.332625 i think inadequate health care uh and in some cases the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces and i think
sw3870B-ms98-a-0006 33.332625 37.449625 um it's inevitable it is just a matter of
sw3870B-ms98-a-0007 37.449625 42.160500 uh time and mistakes and they're both inevitable
sw3870B-ms98-a-0008 42.160500 48.642500 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0009 48.642500 57.639875 well it's gonna make it tough for them and it's it's gonna be a difficult transition i don't know uh how it's gonna uh
sw3870B-ms98-a-0010 57.639875 66.311250 play out in terms of the particulars but i don't think s[ociety]- society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long
sw3870B-ms98-a-0011 66.311250 68.181250 our uh
sw3870B-ms98-a-0012 68.181250 80.020750 physical mental and spiritual health uh it's really very costly uh and uh as a society we are paying a staggering price for this my 
sw3870B-ms98-a-0013 80.020750 100.335125 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0014 100.335125 101.765125 right
sw3870B-ms98-a-0015 101.765125 107.640625 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0016 107.640625 109.831750 um-hum yeah
sw3870B-ms98-a-0017 109.831750 110.848125 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0018 110.848125 114.048750 yeah there are abuses of they're abusive of privilege
sw3870B-ms98-a-0019 114.048750 126.826000 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0020 126.826000 128.026875 right
sw3870B-ms98-a-0021 128.026875 142.626625 well this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten or twenty or thirty years will address because i know this is addressed by uh in Canada i- i have a a good friend who is uh a physician practicing in Canada
sw3870B-ms98-a-0022 142.626625 154.739375 and they made the transition uh and i think that the uh for example duplication of magnetic resonance imagers uh
sw3870B-ms98-a-0023 154.739375 158.139750 i've i had one myself and uh
sw3870B-ms98-a-0024 158.139750 165.174375 they're wonderful technologies but cities have uh three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need
sw3870B-ms98-a-0025 165.174375 173.935750 so i think that what the marketplace doesn't do because of the way the system has worked and it doesn't allocate resources optimally because
sw3870B-ms98-a-0026 173.935750 182.284375 there is a tendency uh at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills
sw3870B-ms98-a-0027 182.284375 191.813500 what's begun to change all of that the people paying the bills uh employers ultimately have begun to squawk because they've seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years
sw3870B-ms98-a-0028 191.813500 201.760250 so i think the evolution will be interesting uh Hawaii has a system that is apparently working and uh it'll be interesting to see how how
sw3870B-ms98-a-0029 201.760250 214.964250 uh much more attention we pay to that i do think though that it's inevitable primarily because of the pain uh that people are feeling uh under the circumstances and i believe that
sw3870B-ms98-a-0030 214.964250 226.397250 it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care whether it's subsidized by the government and and operated by private insurers
sw3870B-ms98-a-0031 226.397250 233.337875 uh i don't know i like that idea i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances
sw3870B-ms98-a-0032 233.337875 244.718875 with the profit incentive work very very well uh i we would be a lot better off if we if we contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste
sw3870B-ms98-a-0033 244.718875 246.657500 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0034 246.657500 256.937750 that's that's that's the problem with government uh uh administration of these programs and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with government is gonna have to change in this regard
sw3870B-ms98-a-0035 256.937750 262.303375 [silence]
sw3870B-ms98-a-0036 262.303375 270.292500 you know that's really a tough one for me to answer i don't uh uh i would like to see the greatest improvement in management
sw3870B-ms98-a-0037 270.292500 278.060250 my my f[ield]- my field is the cognitive sciences and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done are done um
sw3870B-ms98-a-0038 278.060250 289.260750 as a function of the operating systems in place and those operating systems have to change and and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems
sw3870B-ms98-a-0039 289.260750 298.530000 and so a state or federal application uh could work uh it all depends upon the way we structure the environment we may have to do
