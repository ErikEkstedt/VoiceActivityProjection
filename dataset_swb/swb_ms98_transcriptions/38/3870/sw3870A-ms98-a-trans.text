sw3870A-ms98-a-0007 78.769250 92.682625 well this is what's bothering me Lee another question do you think that there should be some control uh innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ri[diculously]- ridiculously over priced things
sw3870A-ms98-a-0008 92.682625 101.136875 we realize that for the individual person some things are very important uh matter of fact in some respects their life might depend on it
sw3870A-ms98-a-0009 101.136875 105.883500 but by the same token some of these charges they make for
sw3870A-ms98-a-0010 105.883500 113.431875 w[ell]- well minor endeavors shall we say on the parts the doctors are really out of line there should be some control of that
sw3870A-ms98-a-0011 113.431875 127.949375 yes and that's what's giving the local um insurance companies hard times that's the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals and you get something done and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it
