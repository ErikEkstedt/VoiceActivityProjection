sw3857A-ms98-a-0037 131.496750 132.859375 and uh
sw3857A-ms98-a-0038 132.859375 139.165750 we recently served it to some guests we had and and uh they all had to have the recipe

sw3857A-ms98-a-0041 149.264875 150.469500 [silence]
sw3857A-ms98-a-0042 150.469500 158.556125 it's just it's very pungent thing and and we just didn't think anybody would like it but they all went nuts about it and i've already heard that two of them have already fixed it at home so
sw3857A-ms98-a-0043 158.556125 159.415000 [noise]

sw3857A-ms98-a-0053 191.485375 199.845500 i think a lot of the lot of the things that i cook and that my wife cooks they're they're from Midwest from Iowa from her background
sw3857A-ms98-a-0054 199.845500 205.330625 because that's where we picked up the recipes and we have a lot of regional cookbooks from that area
sw3857A-ms98-a-0055 205.330625 215.137750 so it's especially when we're baking something boy we just go to those little city cookbooks and we know they've been tried and tested and and everything so
sw3857A-ms98-a-0056 215.137750 226.299625 [silence] 
sw3857A-ms98-a-0057 226.299625 231.345875 yeah uh we lived in New Mexico northern New Mexico for eight years and 
sw3857A-ms98-a-0058 231.345875 234.339875 uh no we lived up at Los Alamos
sw3857A-ms98-a-0059 234.339875 239.320500 so and then up in the mountains but we picked up a lot of uh
sw3857A-ms98-a-0060 239.320500 242.620375 Santa Fe type dishes and uh
sw3857A-ms98-a-0061 242.620375 248.268125 that's usually what we'll fix if company's coming because they uh they expect it
sw3857A-ms98-a-0062 248.268125 249.981375 [silence]
sw3857A-ms98-a-0063 249.981375 251.046750 yeah
sw3857A-ms98-a-0064 251.046750 254.691875 we don't even like to go out to the Mexican restaurants [laughter-around] here
sw3857A-ms98-a-0065 254.691875 258.444750 [silence]

sw3857A-ms98-a-0068 262.060375 270.645875 in this part of the world there's you know there's a lot and there's some from the interior of Mexico and country Mexican cooking and things like that so
sw3857A-ms98-a-0069 270.645875 276.870125 you can get into some unusual things but i still find that you know especially even when we go back to Santa Fe
sw3857A-ms98-a-0070 276.870125 282.202750 that i'd rather have the food from there they just use more cheese and more beans and
sw3857A-ms98-a-0071 282.202750 286.053500 [silence]
sw3857A-ms98-a-0072 286.053500 287.048625 yeah
