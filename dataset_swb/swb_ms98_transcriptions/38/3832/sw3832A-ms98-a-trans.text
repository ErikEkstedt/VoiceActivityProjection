sw3832A-ms98-a-0029 81.079000 89.918250 you know you get into buying as many plants that you need to make it look good and you know you can't just buy two or three you've got to buy a dozen for one small area
sw3832A-ms98-a-0030 89.918250 91.510750 you know so
sw3832A-ms98-a-0031 91.510750 92.583875 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0032 92.583875 98.672875 exactly and i know we've got this spring we've got to push pull a bunch of stumps out because they're
sw3832A-ms98-a-0033 98.672875 101.329625 they kicked the bucket so
sw3832A-ms98-a-0034 101.329625 103.376000 well that means we'll just have to put something else
sw3832A-ms98-a-0035 103.376000 112.181875 and so but you know we haven't we hadn't had any freeze damage this year of course because it hasn't been that cold i guess it's been about the same with you all
sw3832A-ms98-a-0036 112.181875 114.900625 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0037 114.900625 116.617125 yeah and i

sw3832A-ms98-a-0040 121.594375 124.724625 we got a few a few flakes last week
sw3832A-ms98-a-0041 124.724625 131.727375 just enough to make it look you know i mean it didn't even of course settle you know on the ground but it looked pretty while it was coming down
sw3832A-ms98-a-0042 131.727375 133.523750 yeah what about you
sw3832A-ms98-a-0043 133.523750 135.599000 [silence]

sw3832A-ms98-a-0051 156.202125 170.766250 in fact i just had a garden company come by and give me a well you know one of those places that fertilizes your lawn give me an estimate because i just don't want to go out and buy all the chemicals and stuff because because i don't know what you need for this weed versus this weed versus this weed
sw3832A-ms98-a-0052 170.766250 176.858625 so i just let them treat all my weeds and i won't have to deal with you know buying this stuff and having it sit in the garage
sw3832A-ms98-a-0053 176.858625 178.258125 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0054 178.258125 183.354375 well yeah it's better for us because we don't we have a pretty small lawn
sw3832A-ms98-a-0055 183.354375 188.541500 so and and you know the cost i think per time is a little less than thirty bucks so
sw3832A-ms98-a-0056 188.541500 190.248625 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0057 190.248625 193.702250 i don't think they do the ants i think they're just dealing with the weeds
sw3832A-ms98-a-0058 193.702250 195.817125 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0059 195.817125 200.541625 no because we've got a real problem they're overtaking everything
sw3832A-ms98-a-0060 200.541625 205.432750 so but i mean we got some good grass but it's getting you know um
sw3832A-ms98-a-0061 205.432750 206.558625 [silence]
sw3832A-ms98-a-0062 206.558625 209.267625 exactly it's getting choked out

sw3832A-ms98-a-0070 229.550875 231.640000 you use them pretty much yourself
sw3832A-ms98-a-0071 231.640000 233.161625 well that's good
sw3832A-ms98-a-0072 233.161625 241.781250 [silence]
