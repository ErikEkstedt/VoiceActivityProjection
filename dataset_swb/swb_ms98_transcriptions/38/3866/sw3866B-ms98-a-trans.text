sw3866B-ms98-a-0003 6.106375 11.746875 [noise] i guess probably now the TV first paper second an[d]- radio third
sw3866B-ms98-a-0004 11.746875 16.350875 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0005 16.350875 20.495500 yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh
sw3866B-ms98-a-0006 20.495500 28.987125 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0007 28.987125 30.479000 yeah
sw3866B-ms98-a-0008 30.479000 34.381500 yeah i think it's uh i don't know i mean
sw3866B-ms98-a-0009 34.381500 40.132375 it's getting a little bit ridiculous i mean thi[s]- this i don't know if you saw it yesterday but uh
sw3866B-ms98-a-0010 40.132375 50.839000 where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clinton's alleged uh mistress whatever and uh
sw3866B-ms98-a-0011 50.839000 61.495750 it just got to be so i mean it's ridiculous because_1 you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing
sw3866B-ms98-a-0012 61.495750 71.766750 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0013 71.766750 73.329875 right
sw3866B-ms98-a-0014 73.329875 82.253500 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0015 82.253500 94.700750 yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean that's my belief i just think that you know if he did it [vocalized-noise] you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and
sw3866B-ms98-a-0016 94.700750 98.730750 most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you s[ay]- how can you [vocalized-noise]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0017 98.730750 102.671250 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0018 102.671250 104.247500 well now with
sw3866B-ms98-a-0019 104.247500 108.434375 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0020 108.434375 113.955625 yeah but i mean the fact is now that he's left hims[elf]- the fact that he wouldn't deny it or
sw3866B-ms98-a-0021 113.955625 120.816500 confirm it was he's just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know there's all types of rumors now that
sw3866B-ms98-a-0022 120.816500 126.819625 Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas w[ell]- allegedly had a
sw3866B-ms98-a-0023 126.819625 135.539000 thing with him i mean it's just going to keep dogging him i- i think he's going to be out of the race in two weeks just because_1 this is going to keep getting the fact that he won't confirm or deny i mean
sw3866B-ms98-a-0024 135.539000 140.827500 i mean he he's been this has been going on for years though i mean he's always had rumors and stuff and 
sw3866B-ms98-a-0025 140.827500 147.574750 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0026 147.574750 148.916875 yeah and he
sw3866B-ms98-a-0027 148.916875 151.552875 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0028 151.552875 157.072875 no it's just i know it's just i think [vocalized-noise] is just the fact that he uh
sw3866B-ms98-a-0029 157.072875 170.049750 he just flat out lied to the public that he didn't and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and that's what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he
sw3866B-ms98-a-0030 170.049750 177.105375 i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but
sw3866B-ms98-a-0031 177.105375 181.175125 in the end i think he's just going to his people now are you know the
sw3866B-ms98-a-0032 181.175125 188.667500 the fund the campaign you know they're going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then
sw3866B-ms98-a-0033 188.667500 197.013875 i think he'll be out uh you know he'll be out of the race eventually because_1 the money is what uh the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesn't have any money there's not
sw3866B-ms98-a-0034 197.013875 200.496375 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0035 200.496375 203.427500 oh yeah she she's a bimbo i mean you know
sw3866B-ms98-a-0036 203.427500 209.652375 [silence]

sw3866B-ms98-a-0039 211.529000 212.814000 yeah but
sw3866B-ms98-a-0040 212.814000 221.029750 i don't know i mean it's just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mea[n]- Amer[icans]- most i think that most people in America know
sw3866B-ms98-a-0041 221.029750 230.389500 i mean my people my age you know probably probably really don't care i mean what they i really don't you know care what they do as long as it doesn't
sw3866B-ms98-a-0042 230.389500 231.705125 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0043 231.705125 237.837000 but when the press says that you know some it's it's important it's got to be important because i mean they control
sw3866B-ms98-a-0044 237.837000 239.264375 i mean
sw3866B-ms98-a-0045 239.264375 241.732125 what's said and everything and
sw3866B-ms98-a-0046 241.732125 249.102500 yeah i think it's i mean yeah i think it's totally gone overboard and i mean it's [vocalized-noise] issues and everything and the timing of this c[an]-
sw3866B-ms98-a-0047 249.102500 257.592125 can be more worse for him but he he's clearly the front runner now he's about to get blown out of the water at this time
sw3866B-ms98-a-0048 257.592125 262.910875 [silence]
sw3866B-ms98-a-0049 262.910875 264.805000 yeah

sw3866B-ms98-a-0052 276.115750 284.242625 i- i- i just don't think he'll be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know he's he's dodging the subject now you know he says
sw3866B-ms98-a-0053 284.242625 293.313000 he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didn't say anything all he said was that the American public knows that i'm mean you know [vocalized-noise]
