sw3837A-ms98-a-0028 129.772375 134.930750 uh and and that's a good vacation spot too [laughter] but it was nice living there 
sw3837A-ms98-a-0029 134.930750 139.173125 [silence]
sw3837A-ms98-a-0030 139.173125 145.527125 yes i i didn't live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh

sw3837A-ms98-a-0034 162.053125 168.417625 i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there
sw3837A-ms98-a-0035 168.417625 177.462375 [silence]
sw3837A-ms98-a-0036 177.462375 191.025750 yeah it's enjoyable if you if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it it's a little bit frustrating when you're falling a lot but after after you get past that it's a lot of fun 
sw3837A-ms98-a-0037 191.025750 193.333875 [silence]
sw3837A-ms98-a-0038 193.333875 197.179375 well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh
sw3837A-ms98-a-0039 197.179375 203.358000 you can get some nice days skiing as well though if you're if you're not falling you can stay pretty dry [laughter-and] 
sw3837A-ms98-a-0040 203.358000 211.030125 and uh it it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesn't feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me 
sw3837A-ms98-a-0041 211.030125 221.946375 [silence]

sw3837A-ms98-a-0046 231.987750 243.351250 yeah it's i i agree with you it's sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable it's it's a bit little too dry and 
sw3837A-ms98-a-0047 243.351250 248.359125 and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area
sw3837A-ms98-a-0048 248.359125 250.629375 [silence]
