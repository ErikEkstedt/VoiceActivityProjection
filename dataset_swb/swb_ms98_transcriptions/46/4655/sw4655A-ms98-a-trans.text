sw4655A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.545125 [noise] okay
sw4655A-ms98-a-0002 0.545125 13.021875 well i'll just briefly um i worked in a nursing home so i kind of know from way back uh how things used to be run and i think there's been definite changes of nursing homes but
sw4655A-ms98-a-0003 13.021875 20.790000 i think uh if i personally had to put one of my parents in a nursing home they would have to be pretty bad off
sw4655A-ms98-a-0004 20.790000 32.473500 to where i couldn't take care of them at all it would be something that [noise] you know i would certainly [noise] if they're forgetting things or whatever i'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care
sw4655A-ms98-a-0005 32.473500 45.056000 where somebody comes in and they cook meals and they clean their house for them that kind of thing so they still have their own independence and not reliable you know they don't have to be in a nursing home situation but uh
sw4655A-ms98-a-0006 45.056000 57.476125 i don't think the nursing homes when i was working in them were very much understaffed very much uh in need of good personnel um
sw4655A-ms98-a-0007 57.476125 65.189375 i think the patients weren't given the quality of care that i wouldn't have you know i look at it and say thank God i
sw4655A-ms98-a-0008 65.189375 77.820250 got out of that kind of situation but uh they they were not given the time and they were not given the money basically to staff appropriately people to help and
sw4655A-ms98-a-0009 77.820250 86.521625 i can remember lifting a patient all by myself simply because there was not another person to help it's either let leave the patient in bed all day long
sw4655A-ms98-a-0010 86.521625 93.386750 or get them up and i would have preferred to get them up than [laughter] -[th]an to leave them in bed all day but uh
sw4655A-ms98-a-0011 93.386750 100.270750 um so i think nursing homes are have changed i'm not quite sure but hopefully they have
sw4655A-ms98-a-0012 100.270750 105.326375 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0013 105.326375 106.912375 um-hum
sw4655A-ms98-a-0014 106.912375 108.490500 yeah
sw4655A-ms98-a-0015 108.490500 111.505625 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0016 111.505625 112.682375 sure
sw4655A-ms98-a-0017 112.682375 114.720500 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0018 114.720500 115.938750 um-hum
sw4655A-ms98-a-0019 115.938750 123.466500 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0020 123.466500 124.611000 sure
sw4655A-ms98-a-0021 124.611000 125.767250 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0022 125.767250 131.586125 yeah i- i think that's that can happen and i think in the nursing home that i worked for
sw4655A-ms98-a-0023 131.586125 140.996250 i wasn't quite sure of it but i'm sure that some of the patients were uh given medication to keep them_1 in uh quiet and and
sw4655A-ms98-a-0024 140.996250 145.666125 yeah yeah and they would just lay all day long and uh
sw4655A-ms98-a-0025 145.666125 148.906625 the ones tha[t]- they also put mentally ill patients
sw4655A-ms98-a-0026 148.906625 163.566000 in the same they were not on the same you know ward but they they were in the same nursing home so that these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other uh older people that were in there for reasons of uh
sw4655A-ms98-a-0027 163.566000 177.469625 you know age uh the mentally ill patients could walk right in into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically because if you weren't there to watch them_1 and keep them_1 in their own wing they could they had freedom to just walk around and a lot of them_1 were
sw4655A-ms98-a-0028 177.469625 189.522750 i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic and i remember one time watching one of the uh schizophrenic patients actually go out on i don't know what they call it a binge or whatever you want to say it but
sw4655A-ms98-a-0029 189.522750 197.392125 she grabbed a hold of this and it was kind of funny when i look back at it but i mean i remember the patient getting very upset
sw4655A-ms98-a-0030 197.392125 205.829125 that p[erson]- woman actually pulled uh the other person's hair i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair you know and it was a guy that was
sw4655A-ms98-a-0031 205.829125 216.620625 just really upset i mean he's what the hell are you think you're doing you know and i laughed at it then but then i'm thinking God you know if i had to put my parents in that nursing home i wouldn't want them there
sw4655A-ms98-a-0032 216.620625 226.089375 so i think there's laws now that kind of protect that nursing homes either have to keep the mentally ill totally away from these people
sw4655A-ms98-a-0033 226.089375 236.892875 and not in the same type of facilities even though they're aging mentally ill they are still mentally ill and a lot of these older people have their you know
sw4655A-ms98-a-0034 236.892875 242.399250 they're not insane or anything like that they don't have these tendencies to to lash out
sw4655A-ms98-a-0035 242.399250 251.228250 but [vocalized-noise] seeing that kind of made me think twice about jeez i wouldn't put my mother father in that nursing home at all
sw4655A-ms98-a-0036 251.228250 253.408750 a small town
sw4655A-ms98-a-0037 253.408750 255.402375 yeah yeah
sw4655A-ms98-a-0038 255.402375 256.736125 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0039 256.736125 258.246875 i don't know
sw4655A-ms98-a-0040 258.246875 259.338000 [silence]
sw4655A-ms98-a-0041 259.338000 262.838375 i don't know i i kind of look at it this way i think
sw4655A-ms98-a-0042 262.838375 268.490125 if you have a big city area i think there's more people to keep watch on it
sw4655A-ms98-a-0043 268.490125 280.174250 and yeah yeah and you have more competition and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community
sw4655A-ms98-a-0044 280.174250 286.152875 and this is back in nineteen seventy seven that i worked there
sw4655A-ms98-a-0045 286.152875 299.458000 and i look back at it and say jeez you know i it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there but my grandmother uh later on got cancer and uh could no longer well actually she
