sw4626A-ms98-a-0019 72.239750 79.630375 [silence]

sw4626A-ms98-a-0021 81.032750 87.591625 [silence]

sw4626A-ms98-a-0023 88.925250 92.579875 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0024 92.579875 93.809375 uh-huh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0025 93.809375 109.326625 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0026 109.326625 119.145625 huh the um i had a part-time job around oh gosh fifteen years ago seventy six
sw4626A-ms98-a-0027 119.145625 120.659500 and uh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0028 120.659500 134.186625 uh this was a sort of a career shift at the time and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that and i actually did my bank account would uh i had i i kept bouncing checks just at the end of the month 
sw4626A-ms98-a-0029 134.186625 144.654625 but i i had miscalculated i well i didn't keep a balance [laughter] it's one of the problems i never had to in the past i always kept plenty of money in my checking account but when you're only earning half the salary
sw4626A-ms98-a-0030 144.654625 149.259375 even though i wasn't spending much money i sometimes would just things would get to tight
sw4626A-ms98-a-0031 149.259375 154.376000 uh and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet
sw4626A-ms98-a-0032 154.376000 166.615125 and every time i uh i spent money i mean cash mostly i would uh write it down so i could see at the end of a month how much i spent on food so i could do better planning
sw4626A-ms98-a-0033 166.615125 178.092375 but i would forget to write the things down and i[t]- it that i i don't know if i ever went as far as three months or not [laughter] i[n]- in keeping that kind of data i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever 
sw4626A-ms98-a-0034 178.092375 180.294500 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0035 180.294500 181.545625 yeah
sw4626A-ms98-a-0036 181.545625 183.111000 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0037 183.111000 184.517750 uh-huh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0038 184.517750 185.835875 yeah
sw4626A-ms98-a-0039 185.835875 194.949125 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0040 194.949125 196.231750 uh-huh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0041 196.231750 199.755625 [silence]
sw4626A-ms98-a-0042 199.755625 201.123875 uh-huh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0043 201.123875 211.082500 the uh i i- i have to say that let's see at this point on i don't run out of money um and it uh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0044 211.082500 217.411375 a[nd]- and i don't i mean someday if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have
sw4626A-ms98-a-0045 217.411375 226.434625 and i i i i think my strategy if if i may i[s]- i[s]- is is to is to not spend money i mean i don't have expensive tastes 
sw4626A-ms98-a-0046 226.434625 238.186250 i don't go out i mean i buy a car well the last car i got rid of i'd had it was nineteen years old pe[ople]- people were embarrassed for me i mean it was it was a good car and
sw4626A-ms98-a-0047 238.186250 243.459250 oh it was great my my mechanics loved it because it was an old it was a sixty five Buick and it just wouldn't stop
sw4626A-ms98-a-0048 243.459250 248.518250 um and it i i just didn't feel the need for a new car it isn't like i couldn't afford one
sw4626A-ms98-a-0049 248.518250 252.405125 uh and now i mean i i don't uh
sw4626A-ms98-a-0050 252.405125 257.825000 i tend to eat expensive food i mean i don't mind buying a good steak but for me
sw4626A-ms98-a-0051 257.825000 263.153500 i only do that every week or um without even i mean maybe once a month 
sw4626A-ms98-a-0052 263.153500 274.805375 i mean you buy a a tenderloin steak it costs outrageous like twelve dollars a pound you buy a a less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars to me i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that
sw4626A-ms98-a-0053 274.805375 288.899125 but but i'm just i'm just saying as a single person that's that's a drop in the bucket and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food it doesn't add up if you're buying mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants which i don't care to go to 
sw4626A-ms98-a-0054 288.899125 300.226000 so so that's i think one of the reasons i don't need to budget is that i don't have i don't i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because_1 i can't afford it because i'm not interested in that expensive thing
