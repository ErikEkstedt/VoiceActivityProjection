sw4626B-ms98-a-0002 0.371375 4.809500 how are you you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you [laughter-budget]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0003 4.809500 30.238250 [silence]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0004 30.238250 32.656375 [laughter]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0005 32.656375 36.712375 [laughter] that sounds kind of like me
sw4626B-ms98-a-0006 36.712375 45.156875 [silence]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0007 45.156875 48.455875 about the same thing [noise] yeah
sw4626B-ms98-a-0008 48.455875 49.499000 [silence]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0009 49.499000 52.955125 i'm even even in worse shape because_1 i have eight children
sw4626B-ms98-a-0010 52.955125 62.850375 and uh we live from hand to [laughter-mouth] we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not then we [laughter-try] [laughter-to] [laughter] due for the next month
sw4626B-ms98-a-0011 62.850375 63.890000 [silence]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0012 63.890000 69.569750 a cou[ple]- a couple of times we've tried some things and they worked but i'm not disciplined enough
sw4626B-ms98-a-0013 69.569750 71.589125 to keep doing it
sw4626B-ms98-a-0014 71.589125 79.907250 the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we took and uh took my check and divided it out into envelopes
sw4626B-ms98-a-0015 79.907250 88.423125 and then paid for the expenses out of that envelope and when the envelope was empty [laughter] then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area
sw4626B-ms98-a-0016 88.423125 93.184625 and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent
sw4626B-ms98-a-0017 93.184625 97.186125 it was just that when that was empty you knew you were out of money
sw4626B-ms98-a-0018 97.186125 109.879125 and we did that pretty successfully for about three months [laughter-and] then we [laughter-started] [laughter-borrowing] [laughter-from] [laughter-one] [laughter-envelope] [laughter-to] [laughter] [laughter-put] it in the [laughter-other] envelope and [laughter] in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do
sw4626B-ms98-a-0019 109.879125 139.705125 [silence]
sw4626B-ms98-a-0020 139.705125 140.989875 [laughter]

sw4626B-ms98-a-0026 177.017500 184.213000 i even find now like with the automatic tellers i'll go take money out of that and then i forget to take that out of my [laughter-checking] account
sw4626B-ms98-a-0027 184.213000 185.806125 and uh
sw4626B-ms98-a-0028 185.806125 190.118250 so i i i leave a little bit of a slush fund in my checking account
sw4626B-ms98-a-0029 190.118250 195.720625 and i figure that so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there
sw4626B-ms98-a-0030 195.720625 200.527750 and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make
sw4626B-ms98-a-0031 200.527750 233.106875 [silence]
