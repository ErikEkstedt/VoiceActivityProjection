sw4619A-ms98-a-0004 16.094625 25.036000 parents say or or or or like grandparents whatever it is uh who were ready who who who you thought might benefit from a nursing home what do you think you would look for

sw4619A-ms98-a-0014 55.996750 64.046625 well my uh uh my wife's grandmother is in a nursing home in uh Minnesota and we go there
sw4619A-ms98-a-0015 64.046625 71.586875 uh once a year we see we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away when we visit Minnesota though we go to see her and it seems
sw4619A-ms98-a-0016 71.586875 76.559250 um i mean the the environment there i don't know too much about it but it it seems
sw4619A-ms98-a-0017 76.559250 88.880375 nice enough uh it it's hard at least half of the residents i would say are not not mentally sound so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to re[tain]- to retain
sw4619A-ms98-a-0018 88.880375 90.251125 um
sw4619A-ms98-a-0019 90.251125 92.678625 clarity say uh you know it
sw4619A-ms98-a-0020 92.678625 103.236375 y[eah]- yeah well i- i- i don['t]- i don't know we we also uh my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's a just a mile from our house we um 
sw4619A-ms98-a-0021 103.236375 112.387875 she goes more often than i we used to go maybe once a month or once every two months to visit some of the patients there and we'd take we have a two year old son and so we sometimes we'd take him with and
sw4619A-ms98-a-0022 112.387875 123.711875 uh there i would say it's the same thing it's a it's a nice uh is relatively nice environment but again um it must be depressing for the people who who are who who are just
sw4619A-ms98-a-0023 123.711875 127.685875 [vocalized-noise] too old ess[entially]- essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house
sw4619A-ms98-a-0024 127.685875 140.804500 but but certainly um certainly have a[re]- a[re]- are have retained all of their uh mental skills and so on it's must be depressing to to walk walk the halls and see an[d]- and see all these other people who really don't know where they are
sw4619A-ms98-a-0025 140.804500 150.640875 [silence]
sw4619A-ms98-a-0026 150.640875 160.145125 i think s[o]- yeah i think they're relatively re[spectful]- respectful yeah and and concerned that in as much as they can be i- i think sometimes you know i've noticed
sw4619A-ms98-a-0027 160.145125 171.561500 uh people asking for uh some of the patients asking for things uh just repetitively and for things that are not reasonable and so a[t]- at some level the the the um
sw4619A-ms98-a-0028 171.561500 175.216000 i'm sure that the that the uh the staff
sw4619A-ms98-a-0029 175.216000 186.262500 l[earn]- learn what's normal for this person so it looks to me like maybe they're not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just [vocalized-noise] you know is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need you know
sw4619A-ms98-a-0030 186.262500 190.478750 [silence]
sw4619A-ms98-a-0031 190.478750 191.902000 oh yeah
sw4619A-ms98-a-0032 191.902000 200.644750 [silence]
sw4619A-ms98-a-0033 200.644750 206.415500 yeah i'll tell you one thing though though that that i- i s[aw]- saw that was really nice we saw husband and wife
sw4619A-ms98-a-0034 206.415500 217.487000 we used to see a husband and wife in there uh together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were and when you walked into their room they had brought all their furniture from their house
sw4619A-ms98-a-0035 217.487000 219.018000 and so y[ou]-
sw4619A-ms98-a-0036 219.018000 228.788375 yeah you walked in there and it didn't look like uh you know how you you walk into some rooms and there's it's completely generic there's nothing maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it
sw4619A-ms98-a-0037 228.788375 237.425500 but this room on the other hand you know they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like a
sw4619A-ms98-a-0038 237.425500 247.582375 i[t]- i[t]- it must have b[een]- it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of uh uh security and and uh and and you know s[ecurity]- s[ecurity]- uh
sw4619A-ms98-a-0039 247.582375 259.150625 [silence]
