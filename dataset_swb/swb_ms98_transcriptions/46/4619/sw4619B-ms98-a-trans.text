sw4619B-ms98-a-0004 1.955750 7.984750 so we're um our discussion's about uh the care of the elderly
sw4619B-ms98-a-0005 7.984750 25.289500 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0006 25.289500 32.617000 um well i actually my dad's my dad's almost ninety and he lives by himself and he's in good shape um
sw4619B-ms98-a-0007 32.617000 40.704000 but um some friends of mine have um gone through this i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention
sw4619B-ms98-a-0008 40.704000 46.905250 and um where they did some things to and try to keep them um mentally alive 
sw4619B-ms98-a-0009 46.905250 56.577625 and where there was um caring and compassionate where there were caring and compassionate people uh operating it do you have any experience with this yourself
sw4619B-ms98-a-0010 56.577625 60.113000 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0011 60.113000 61.338500 um-hum

sw4619B-ms98-a-0014 71.147250 91.432375 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0015 91.432375 93.904375 from the lack of stimulation you mean
sw4619B-ms98-a-0016 93.904375 140.027000 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0017 140.027000 151.484375 do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with that the people who operate it seem to have what you'd perceive of as genuine concern
sw4619B-ms98-a-0018 151.484375 165.694625 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0019 165.694625 167.532375 um-hum
sw4619B-ms98-a-0020 167.532375 169.157125 yeah
sw4619B-ms98-a-0021 169.157125 185.384500 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0022 185.384500 196.208125 yeah it it's possible i was thinking also that there'd be there could be a fair um burn out factor um in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are
sw4619B-ms98-a-0023 196.208125 201.490500 sometimes depending on the person not gonna be what we would perceive of as rational needs
sw4619B-ms98-a-0024 201.490500 213.365375 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0025 213.365375 214.579875 um-hum
sw4619B-ms98-a-0026 214.579875 217.063375 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0027 217.063375 219.843875 um-hum so it gives them a sense of identity
sw4619B-ms98-a-0028 219.843875 246.490500 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0029 246.490500 255.996875 yeah i- i think part of what you're saying matches what i h[ave]- have read i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who
sw4619B-ms98-a-0030 255.996875 262.252500 um were adequately deficient in their abilities um physical or mental that they couldn't take care of themselves
sw4619B-ms98-a-0031 262.252500 269.803875 but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide um a lot of social activities
sw4619B-ms98-a-0032 269.803875 281.001375 um the one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation um and
sw4619B-ms98-a-0033 281.001375 282.440625 [silence]
sw4619B-ms98-a-0034 282.440625 291.509625 well i think it i think it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and i feel like
sw4619B-ms98-a-0035 291.509625 299.042000 the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like like put her in there and there there's so much
