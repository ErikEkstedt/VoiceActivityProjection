sw4669B-ms98-a-0042 133.584250 135.599000 i made an armoire
sw4669B-ms98-a-0043 135.599000 138.555750 recently for my wife's store
sw4669B-ms98-a-0044 138.555750 142.819625 and the top of it has curved crown molding
sw4669B-ms98-a-0045 142.819625 144.296750 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0046 144.296750 145.956125 that will
sw4669B-ms98-a-0047 145.956125 149.282125 yeah uh-huh it sure did [laughter]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0048 149.282125 153.420500 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0049 153.420500 154.813125 well
sw4669B-ms98-a-0050 154.813125 168.647500 what you had t[o]- it wasn't what i did was i made it up out of the crown molding around the top and the the tricky part was not making up the crown molding it was how did you cut it how did you miter the corners
sw4669B-ms98-a-0051 168.647500 176.226625 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0052 176.226625 177.787875 uh-huh
sw4669B-ms98-a-0053 177.787875 181.319375 no i don't build it if somebody is not buying it
sw4669B-ms98-a-0054 181.319375 187.948875 i mean uh i build a uh i have a stock English garden bench which i make
sw4669B-ms98-a-0055 187.948875 193.162375 which i instead of making out of redwood which is really dear on the east coast
sw4669B-ms98-a-0056 193.162375 198.357750 is i make it up out of your regularly old forty CPI pressure treated lumber
sw4669B-ms98-a-0057 198.357750 200.458625 and then paint it
sw4669B-ms98-a-0058 200.458625 203.048500 which saves on the cost
sw4669B-ms98-a-0059 203.048500 207.255750 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0060 207.255750 214.328250 yeah teak is awfully expensive but the the thing about teak is you can't set it on the ground
sw4669B-ms98-a-0061 214.328250 219.270625 you have to set it like on flagstone or concrete or something
sw4669B-ms98-a-0062 219.270625 225.456250 yeah it's just not made for direct ground contact it pulls the [vocalized-noise] pulls the oil right out of it 
sw4669B-ms98-a-0063 225.456250 230.733625 it it's all right outside if you go out every year and you know oil it
sw4669B-ms98-a-0064 230.733625 231.791500 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0065 231.791500 238.719875 but you know the the old green pressure treated you can ignore it if the paint falls off it's still not going to hurt the wood
sw4669B-ms98-a-0066 238.719875 242.493375 you know the paint's only just to cover up the fact it's green
sw4669B-ms98-a-0067 242.493375 246.390375 [silence]
sw4669B-ms98-a-0068 246.390375 247.784375 oh oh
