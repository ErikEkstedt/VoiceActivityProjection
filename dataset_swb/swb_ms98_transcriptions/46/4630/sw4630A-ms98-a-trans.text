sw4630A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.039375 [noise]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0002 0.039375 1.742875 um i basically
sw4630A-ms98-a-0003 1.742875 7.342250 uh listen to the news from the TV that's probably the only time i get a chance to uh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0004 7.342250 16.512250 uh take a look at it is the evening news and and then if i'm lucky i might be able to s[omething]- hear something through news wise but um other than that
sw4630A-ms98-a-0005 16.512250 23.633500 now that's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me about it through uh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0006 23.633500 30.352875 um you know uh through conversation or whatever but uh most of the time it's through the news in the evening so
sw4630A-ms98-a-0007 30.352875 31.589000 [vocalized-noise]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0008 31.589000 40.222000 newspapers no i'm not too much in reading newspapers uh not that i don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that but um
sw4630A-ms98-a-0009 40.222000 46.169375 part of it is because i just don't feel like i need the need to have them uh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0010 46.169375 51.815125 with watching the TV or whatever we get our weekly news around the area and i might
sw4630A-ms98-a-0011 51.815125 60.780750 look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest uh in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state but
sw4630A-ms98-a-0012 60.780750 69.050250 the majority of the time now i don't get a daily newspaper where you know i get tons of um news coming in that kind of stuff so
sw4630A-ms98-a-0013 69.050250 71.032375 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0014 71.032375 74.307125 oh you do [laughter]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0015 74.307125 77.581750 you read it in the morning then yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0016 77.581750 79.107250 um-hum
sw4630A-ms98-a-0017 79.107250 80.115125 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0018 80.115125 81.163625 sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0019 81.163625 90.971750 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0020 90.971750 93.653500 oh sure [laughter]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0021 93.653500 100.490375 to see if they did it or if they uh criticize you or put something in there wrong sure sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0022 100.490375 107.228750 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0023 107.228750 109.322000 um-hum sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0024 109.322000 111.624625 sure exactly
sw4630A-ms98-a-0025 111.624625 116.722500 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0026 116.722500 118.034750 uh-huh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0027 118.034750 119.158625 sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0028 119.158625 120.073250 that's
sw4630A-ms98-a-0029 120.073250 125.040625 that's kind of like you said then we we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and uh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0030 125.040625 134.948500 while i'm cooking supper the TV's on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what's going on and uh very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock so by that time
sw4630A-ms98-a-0031 134.948500 139.675000 you know news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever but uh
sw4630A-ms98-a-0032 139.675000 146.628375 unless there's a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the TV to find out what was going on
sw4630A-ms98-a-0033 146.628375 149.754750 but um other than that no it's
sw4630A-ms98-a-0034 149.754750 153.574375 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0035 153.574375 156.277500 [laughter-exactly] exactly
sw4630A-ms98-a-0036 156.277500 157.588000 exactly
sw4630A-ms98-a-0037 157.588000 158.669625 sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0038 158.669625 160.273125 yep yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0039 160.273125 161.388750 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0040 161.388750 163.115250 um-hum yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0041 163.115250 164.171000 yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0042 164.171000 170.363625 well it brought kind of more of a vivid uh look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and
sw4630A-ms98-a-0043 170.363625 173.310500 just a lot of different things but um
sw4630A-ms98-a-0044 173.310500 182.395875 yeah that's true you know you know a lot of people that read the news to newspapers to get the news of what's going on and uh other people that you know
sw4630A-ms98-a-0045 182.395875 187.982250 do it differently or don't even watch any news at all so
sw4630A-ms98-a-0046 187.982250 189.484500 but
sw4630A-ms98-a-0047 189.484500 199.130375 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0048 199.130375 202.743250 exactly happens sure sure that's
sw4630A-ms98-a-0049 202.743250 207.532125 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0050 207.532125 218.703125 oh sure a clip you know a sentence or two and that's about it of what went on and uh they have so much other information to cover in just a short period of time sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0051 218.703125 219.998625 makes sense
sw4630A-ms98-a-0052 219.998625 221.004625 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0053 221.004625 223.706750 [laughter-yeah] yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0054 223.706750 224.745875 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0055 224.745875 227.120750 yeah yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0056 227.120750 232.215375 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0057 232.215375 233.778750 um-hum
sw4630A-ms98-a-0058 233.778750 238.269375 so you're right on the coast line you're not uh further up you're
sw4630A-ms98-a-0059 238.269375 240.510375 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0060 240.510375 241.791375 um-hum
sw4630A-ms98-a-0061 241.791375 244.025625 sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0062 244.025625 248.035000 sure i suppose you watch for hurr[icanes]- hurricanes coming in and
sw4630A-ms98-a-0063 248.035000 250.654125 things like that sure yeah
sw4630A-ms98-a-0064 250.654125 255.845250 yeah that's about the only time in the in the summer um
sw4630A-ms98-a-0065 255.845250 269.074250 if you're watching TV for the weather even though it's very hard to predict what's going on they'll kind of say well there's a thunderstorm warning or whatever this is the what is expected but a lot of times things happen and change here
sw4630A-ms98-a-0066 269.074250 271.612000 so drastically uh so fast
sw4630A-ms98-a-0067 271.612000 276.482250 you know where movement that was coming in has shifted or whatever so
sw4630A-ms98-a-0068 276.482250 277.672000 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0069 277.672000 279.056000 um-hum
sw4630A-ms98-a-0070 279.056000 283.137250 [silence]
sw4630A-ms98-a-0071 283.137250 284.552000 um-hum
sw4630A-ms98-a-0072 284.552000 285.868375 sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0073 285.868375 288.548750 [laughter] to take off sure
sw4630A-ms98-a-0074 288.548750 290.184375 yeah that's
sw4630A-ms98-a-0075 290.184375 292.700625 sounds pretty good so
sw4630A-ms98-a-0076 292.700625 297.561250 anyway i don't know if our time is getting up here or it's got to be fairly close to that
sw4630A-ms98-a-0077 297.561250 298.562000 [silence]
