sw4624A-ms98-a-0018 95.656625 96.658625 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0019 96.658625 98.368125 family right
sw4624A-ms98-a-0020 98.368125 100.572000 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0021 100.572000 104.683000 yeah [vocalized-noise] they they fixed it so you had to give some information out but
sw4624A-ms98-a-0022 104.683000 108.625000 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0023 108.625000 110.225875 right

sw4624A-ms98-a-0027 123.751000 124.973625 -[y]eah the[y]-
sw4624A-ms98-a-0028 124.973625 137.064625 i- i think in general you know technology as nice as it is is causing a lot it's just too easy now to it's like you know Bay banks used to be you know you could do anything over the phone
sw4624A-ms98-a-0029 137.064625 143.082500 you had to know your pin number but i could jus[t]- i could just say to it empty my whole account out if i wanted transfer things
sw4624A-ms98-a-0030 143.082500 150.508500 and you know there there's a lot of of risk involved there because you know it it's like you know the best example is probably credit reports now
sw4624A-ms98-a-0031 150.508500 158.467750 where where you know God knows what goes on those things i mean th[ankfully]- thankfully now you can get your reports for free at least from TRW
sw4624A-ms98-a-0032 158.467750 169.541375 but it it it it's like i[t's]- it's this anonymous thing where anyone can dump any information they want about you in there with no real [vocalized-noise] opportunity to rebut unless you want to go and get the report and then
sw4624A-ms98-a-0033 169.541375 179.504000 you know and then y[ou]- y[ou]- you find out you can go for a house or something all of a sudden you find out what all these people have been you know dumping information about you in there and i've heard of cases where it was just done vindictively
sw4624A-ms98-a-0034 179.504000 189.008750 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0035 189.008750 190.243875 yeah

sw4624A-ms98-a-0037 197.549250 199.107000 yeah
sw4624A-ms98-a-0038 199.107000 208.022500 yeah when i when i applied for my Gold MasterCard they said well you have to close this other MasterCard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago
sw4624A-ms98-a-0039 208.022500 211.899500 and i had to get a letter from this other company saying that i had closed it
sw4624A-ms98-a-0040 211.899500 217.787875 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0041 217.787875 218.924375 yeah

sw4624A-ms98-a-0044 230.415500 241.182750 oh it it it's very slippery though because you know it's [vocalized-noise] one of the things you do when you when you sign those little credit applications is there's all sorts of {disclaimerage} at the bottom about
sw4624A-ms98-a-0045 241.182750 253.106375 how you know you're permitting them to ch[eck]- do credit checks of you and to make your information available to other people and by the time you get through reading it you've basically permitted them to you know broadcast on the evening news your credit rating
sw4624A-ms98-a-0046 253.106375 258.985000 [silence]

sw4624A-ms98-a-0049 262.055750 268.638750 well you know there's much more subtle kinds of invasions of privac[y]- like every time you call an eight hundred number you're giving them_1 your phone number
sw4624A-ms98-a-0050 268.638750 271.104375 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0051 271.104375 275.519250 yeah we're we both probably signed up for this in the same [laughter-place] 
sw4624A-ms98-a-0052 275.519250 280.095125 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0053 280.095125 287.832125 A N I yeah but to some extent i'm not as worried about that because_1 yeah you're you're getting a value for that you're getting to call these people for free
sw4624A-ms98-a-0054 287.832125 291.317250 [silence]
sw4624A-ms98-a-0055 291.317250 292.483000 um-hum
