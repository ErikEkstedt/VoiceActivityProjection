sw4603B-ms98-a-0015 75.151375 78.687500 i i think that might be talking referring to uh
sw4603B-ms98-a-0016 78.687500 83.855000 something kind of uh alternative to the draft you know either you have
sw4603B-ms98-a-0017 83.855000 91.315375 uh military service or some sort of alternative nonmilitary service for a few years

sw4603B-ms98-a-0028 126.050250 127.378875 yeah i uh
sw4603B-ms98-a-0029 127.378875 141.065500 yeah i[t]- i[t]- for for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative uh public service for uh young people to go into uh after high school um i[t]-
sw4603B-ms98-a-0030 141.065500 145.382500 kind of i[n]- in lieu of the draft for p[eople]- for people who don't
sw4603B-ms98-a-0031 145.382500 150.686250 uh who you know are conscientious objectors or don't otherwise wanna
sw4603B-ms98-a-0032 150.686250 160.526500 uh be in the military you know say okay well you can go into the military or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and and
sw4603B-ms98-a-0033 160.526500 166.808625 learn about things and i[t's]- it's it's interesting because i i'm not a particular fan of the military
sw4603B-ms98-a-0034 166.808625 172.093750 but i have seen a lot of people a lot of young guys go in that don't have
sw4603B-ms98-a-0035 172.093750 181.245875 really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined you know e[ven]- even just personal discipline about what they want to do and
sw4603B-ms98-a-0036 181.245875 187.316875 they come out and they they at least have now they have at least some marginally marketable skills
sw4603B-ms98-a-0037 187.316875 196.965625 and m[ore]- more discipline and they have uh you know in in some cases they have a greater self-esteem because they can say they can see that you know if i do something
sw4603B-ms98-a-0038 196.965625 207.016500 pursue submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever at least for a short period of time i can accomplish a lot and it it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn
sw4603B-ms98-a-0039 207.016500 212.001375 that they don't need to be you know cowboys they don't need to be out there and
sw4603B-ms98-a-0040 212.001375 216.441500 uh you know constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished
sw4603B-ms98-a-0041 216.441500 227.408875 and you know for some for some young men that's good for me it would have been lousy i[dea]- idea uh because i i did have th[e]- the personal discipline and i went to college four years and got out you know so
sw4603B-ms98-a-0042 227.408875 238.333375 but um you know for some people that's good i i don't particular like the fact that it's the military you know and because the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially as as an instrument of US foreign policy
sw4603B-ms98-a-0043 238.333375 240.880625 [silence]
sw4603B-ms98-a-0044 240.880625 246.836375 [noise] well that's one view [laughter] and you know and
sw4603B-ms98-a-0045 246.836375 250.584750 that's that's another debate but uh it's
sw4603B-ms98-a-0046 250.584750 252.032000 um
sw4603B-ms98-a-0047 252.032000 255.985750 [silence]
sw4603B-ms98-a-0048 255.985750 257.338000 um-hum
sw4603B-ms98-a-0049 257.338000 258.827250 [silence]
sw4603B-ms98-a-0050 258.827250 261.981000 right right and j[ust]- well it's
sw4603B-ms98-a-0051 261.981000 270.627500 it it seems pretty aggress[ive]- aggressive oriented i mean you you look at the last miss[ion]- military action which was in the Persian Gulf and wasn't anywhere near the United States
sw4603B-ms98-a-0052 270.627500 276.907125 and it was um you know it was definitely a projection of US power
sw4603B-ms98-a-0053 276.907125 278.887750 on the other side of the globe
sw4603B-ms98-a-0054 278.887750 287.359750 so at at any rate this is getting off the topic but i[t]- my my point was that there is for people who don't want to do the military service there
sw4603B-ms98-a-0055 287.359750 296.472625 it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and um sense of community
sw4603B-ms98-a-0056 296.472625 298.850000 that d[o]- do i guess the Boy Scouts
