sw4603A-ms98-a-0002 0.220750 1.363000 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0003 1.363000 3.000500 uh
sw4603A-ms98-a-0004 3.000500 6.116875 well you know um
sw4603A-ms98-a-0005 6.116875 7.848750 [noise] i
sw4603A-ms98-a-0006 7.848750 9.073125 think
sw4603A-ms98-a-0007 9.073125 16.851000 public service is a worthy thing and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs uh such as Peace Corps that promote that
sw4603A-ms98-a-0008 16.851000 24.967500 probably the most popular one but uh one that is not typically recognized as such is the Boy Scouts
sw4603A-ms98-a-0009 24.967500 33.220000 uh i know that f[rom]- because my son is a a scout now and uh is thinking about his Eagle
sw4603A-ms98-a-0010 33.220000 43.108250 and uh in order to get Eagle you have to have merit badges in um citizenship in the community citizenship in the nation citizenship in the world
sw4603A-ms98-a-0011 43.108250 46.845500 and you have to do a public service project
sw4603A-ms98-a-0012 46.845500 50.742875 uh in which leadership is the key element
sw4603A-ms98-a-0013 50.742875 51.749250 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0014 51.749250 53.616875 i um
sw4603A-ms98-a-0015 53.616875 55.314875 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0016 55.314875 62.670125 i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because um
sw4603A-ms98-a-0017 62.670125 68.357250 it's talking about uh a requirement for public service
sw4603A-ms98-a-0018 68.357250 74.359375 uh and of course Pea[ce]- the Peace Corps the Boy Scouts is a [vocalized-noise] is a voluntary activity
sw4603A-ms98-a-0019 74.359375 76.463875 uh
sw4603A-ms98-a-0020 76.463875 90.100500 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0021 90.100500 92.646125 right of course um
sw4603A-ms98-a-0022 92.646125 99.042375 uh military service falls under the category uh of a public service
sw4603A-ms98-a-0023 99.042375 111.316250 and so uh one of the things that would fulfill the at least the nominal uh qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft
sw4603A-ms98-a-0024 111.316250 117.804000 uh but i agree with you that probably is not what was comprehended there are other things such as civil service
sw4603A-ms98-a-0025 117.804000 128.426125 um which many people uh are lifelong employees of but i suspect that that's not what they had in mind either more of a voluntary kind of thing or uh
sw4603A-ms98-a-0026 128.426125 139.151375 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0027 139.151375 140.514625 um-hum
sw4603A-ms98-a-0028 140.514625 215.941250 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0029 215.941250 217.660125 [laughter]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0030 217.660125 221.324375 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0031 221.324375 222.622625 why 
sw4603A-ms98-a-0032 222.622625 224.102875 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0033 224.102875 225.437625 why is that
sw4603A-ms98-a-0034 225.437625 236.996875 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0035 236.996875 241.610625 oh no no no it's to defend the nation against external evils
sw4603A-ms98-a-0036 241.610625 251.397875 [silence]
sw4603A-ms98-a-0037 251.397875 259.470875 well it depends on whether you whether we figure that we have that we have a defense oriented military or an aggressive aggression oriented military
