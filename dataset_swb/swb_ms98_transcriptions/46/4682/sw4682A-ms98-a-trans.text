sw4682A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.038500 [noise]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0002 0.038500 2.807375 have you had that experience recently
sw4682A-ms98-a-0003 2.807375 19.360250 [silence]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0004 19.360250 20.986500 oh yeah
sw4682A-ms98-a-0005 20.986500 55.502000 [silence]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0006 55.502000 59.969375 well i don't have so much trouble with products as service
sw4682A-ms98-a-0007 59.969375 69.886125 i don't feel like that's as big a problem i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly
sw4682A-ms98-a-0008 69.886125 73.552125 and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent
sw4682A-ms98-a-0009 73.552125 77.175625 um the one i have now is okay most of the time
sw4682A-ms98-a-0010 77.175625 84.057625 but that's it but that's that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed
sw4682A-ms98-a-0011 84.057625 91.052625 uh James Avery i don't know if you have that up there but it's it's a very good company that sells sterling silver things and
sw4682A-ms98-a-0012 91.052625 96.603875 uh she has a charm bracelet with lots of charms on it a lot of money into it by now
sw4682A-ms98-a-0013 96.603875 107.664500 and the catch broke and she was sitting in school on a carpet and when she stood up it caught and broke and we took it back and they said oh this was just obviously yanked
sw4682A-ms98-a-0014 107.664500 111.420875 this was yanked i mean they were so rude about it
sw4682A-ms98-a-0015 111.420875 123.154625 and so we wanted a different kind of catch and she said well it's not guaranteed and i said well put it on because apparently nothing's guaranteed so do it anyway so we got the kind we wanted
sw4682A-ms98-a-0016 123.154625 128.929500 and i was really disappointed with that i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable
sw4682A-ms98-a-0017 128.929500 139.702750 and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends and i called there to see if they had it and the lady was very nice and i said my goodness i said you've been very nice what's your name
sw4682A-ms98-a-0018 139.702750 149.517750 and she told me and i said well i really appreciate it i said there seems to be a big attitude problem in that store and it turned out she was the assistant manager
sw4682A-ms98-a-0019 149.517750 151.032750 so
sw4682A-ms98-a-0020 151.032750 158.792750 [vocalized-noise] right so i felt kind of good about that you know i didn't even know the person's name that had [gaven/given] me the hard time or anything but
sw4682A-ms98-a-0021 158.792750 164.469250 i just felt like well at least i did something maybe they'll fix it they might work on that you know
sw4682A-ms98-a-0022 164.469250 170.256625 but i find attitudes are more of a problem service is more of a problem
sw4682A-ms98-a-0023 170.256625 180.442750 [silence]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0024 180.442750 181.897875 really
sw4682A-ms98-a-0025 181.897875 215.045375 [silence]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0026 215.045375 217.621625 that's really great
sw4682A-ms98-a-0027 217.621625 272.938000 [silence]
sw4682A-ms98-a-0028 272.938000 279.588125 that's really good it used to be like that but i don't think most places are like that anymore
