sw4682B-ms98-a-0040 169.160250 182.671125 i find up here in the Northeast we have um well we we have these mail order companies like LL Bean and uh they are famous for i guess r[eally]- having really top notch service they've got um i mean i've i've
sw4682B-ms98-a-0041 182.671125 192.067500 i i have friends and family who order from them because you can you can literally i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year
sw4682B-ms98-a-0042 192.067500 194.542000 wear it for a year and a half
sw4682B-ms98-a-0043 194.542000 209.262375 and even after like eighteen months of you know reasonably satisfactory use they will accept it in any condition and they will gladly no questions asked take it back if for some [vocalized-noise] bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore
sw4682B-ms98-a-0044 209.262375 216.172625 um they'll they'll actually do things like this i mean they're really they they go they bend over backwards {servicewise} for you i've um 
sw4682B-ms98-a-0045 216.172625 225.126000 [noise] i've found also a lot of companies nowadays have they have eight hundred numbers you can call i guess [vocalized-noise] if you if you call the eight eight eight hundred number
sw4682B-ms98-a-0046 225.126000 235.577250 um if you you can call up eight eight eight hundred number directory assistance and you can get um the eight hundred number uh the customer service support line for a number of companies
sw4682B-ms98-a-0047 235.577250 245.421250 and um actually i've tried that out with a few companies lately and they've most of them have been pretty good but i i was one reason why i like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that uh
sw4682B-ms98-a-0048 245.421250 254.291000 if you buy through Bean or though um i guess Bean's one of Bean's big competitors is Lands' End out in uh i guess it's Wisconsin somewhere they
sw4682B-ms98-a-0049 254.291000 263.517500 they are um they're very good about um insuring like the customer's always right and you know [vocalized-noise] no matter how crabby you might be over the phone they
sw4682B-ms98-a-0050 263.517500 273.391500 are very understanding and uh they usually get you know they they make things very they make s[ure]- make sure things are set properly if you're in any way dissatisfied with their merchandise

sw4682B-ms98-a-0055 279.142125 282.392125 yeah well i think i guess nowadays with the uh
sw4682B-ms98-a-0056 282.392125 286.927875 with the economy the way it is i guess there was a there was a story on the news tonight about how
sw4682B-ms98-a-0057 286.927875 298.178000 because a lot of companies are um you know things are getting rough out there there's a lot of you know the the morale among employees tends to go down and that in turn like you know of course makes you
