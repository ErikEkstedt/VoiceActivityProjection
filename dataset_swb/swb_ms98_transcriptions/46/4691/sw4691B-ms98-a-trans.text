sw4691B-ms98-a-0003 3.503250 8.389000 well it let's put it this way we've got the New England Patriots up here so
sw4691B-ms98-a-0004 8.389000 12.217125 they've had some serious problems in the past couple years
sw4691B-ms98-a-0005 12.217125 22.309000 [noise] yeah um well uh partly due to ownership you know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years and
sw4691B-ms98-a-0006 22.309000 28.623000 he always had this uh this wonderful quality of qua[lity]- being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something
sw4691B-ms98-a-0007 28.623000 35.196625 and uh they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to uh some other people
sw4691B-ms98-a-0008 35.196625 42.599375 so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England [arear/area] anyways
sw4691B-ms98-a-0009 42.599375 44.462375 [silence]

sw4691B-ms98-a-0028 95.380875 98.064875 well i[t's]- it's a good past time
sw4691B-ms98-a-0029 98.064875 100.216000 you know particularly football
sw4691B-ms98-a-0030 100.216000 110.082500 they say uh i[t]- football attracts more men because of the you know y[ou]- the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh
sw4691B-ms98-a-0031 110.082500 116.815125 that um men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they um
sw4691B-ms98-a-0032 116.815125 125.127250 uh and they have a good time and everything and that's suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh
sw4691B-ms98-a-0033 125.127250 137.398875 well no it's a it's good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact it's a contact sport it has the speed
sw4691B-ms98-a-0034 137.398875 142.217625 and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey
sw4691B-ms98-a-0035 142.217625 149.375500 so we and that's we're a big hockey area up here hotbed up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area but

sw4691B-ms98-a-0043 166.207375 175.916500 yeah i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now like they have this World Football League
sw4691B-ms98-a-0044 175.916500 186.473625 you see we have the NFL that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and LA Raiders and those teams [noise] there are those teams that play in professional the National Football League
sw4691B-ms98-a-0045 186.473625 198.625875 but uh now they have what's called the World Football League and they have all these teams from there's a team in London and there's a team [noise] there's a there's a uh teams in other European teams and there's teams in the United States 
sw4691B-ms98-a-0046 198.625875 203.673750 an[d]- and and they're playing now during the summer months and it's really [noise] you know overkill
