sw4638A-ms98-a-0002 0.036500 3.225125 well do you have any good ideas about this problem 
sw4638A-ms98-a-0003 3.225125 7.500625 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0004 7.500625 9.056875 right
sw4638A-ms98-a-0005 9.056875 17.378250 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0006 17.378250 18.838000 uh-huh
sw4638A-ms98-a-0007 18.838000 30.845500 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0008 30.845500 32.460500 right
sw4638A-ms98-a-0009 32.460500 40.331625 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0010 40.331625 46.289750 yeah well i have the same thing [laughter] and i understand because_1 i live very close to Dallas
sw4638A-ms98-a-0011 46.289750 54.624250 so we have quite a crime rate too but i'm not real sure what to do recently it's been kind of a topic at work and
sw4638A-ms98-a-0012 54.624250 62.375125 um i just kind of feel that there's a lot of people in jail for crimes that are not really against a person
sw4638A-ms98-a-0013 62.375125 70.686875 and i think maybe we need to find another way to punish those people and put the real criminals in jail where they
sw4638A-ms98-a-0014 70.686875 81.780125 really can't do any harm and not let them out on parole in six months or three years or whatever and put them to work doing something useful where they don't just eat up our tax dollars
sw4638A-ms98-a-0015 81.780125 88.073625 and that's kind of what we've come up with [laughter] but i don't know what are your feelings about that
sw4638A-ms98-a-0016 88.073625 92.314875 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0017 92.314875 97.476000 right well a dangerous thing you know where you will get hurt if they're out on the streets
sw4638A-ms98-a-0018 97.476000 102.798500 i mean it i think this deal of Leona Helmsley has just kind of brought this all home
sw4638A-ms98-a-0019 102.798500 111.006125 and that's what kind of sparked the discussion was that this is a seventy seventy two year old lady gonna go use up tax dollars in jail
sw4638A-ms98-a-0020 111.006125 119.965000 and i just i just have a real problem with that i think there's another way to deal with that other than put this lady in jail to set an example
sw4638A-ms98-a-0021 119.965000 122.818750 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0022 122.818750 124.403125 that's right
sw4638A-ms98-a-0023 124.403125 126.867875 you know that really is true
sw4638A-ms98-a-0024 126.867875 138.367125 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0025 138.367125 143.287500 well that's true well that is a potential danger though you're right about that but
sw4638A-ms98-a-0026 143.287500 151.645125 um traffic tickets things like that i mean i've known of people just to be picked up because they didn't pay their traffic tickets and
sw4638A-ms98-a-0027 151.645125 159.151375 i- i say yeah fine them extra do whatever but to go ahead and put them in jail it costs us money when they do that
sw4638A-ms98-a-0028 159.151375 173.166750 so i don't know i just have a problem with overcrowded jails on crimes that nobody's really gonna get hurt uh financially maybe and and things like that and yes it has to be dealt with but i'm not sure that's the way
sw4638A-ms98-a-0029 173.166750 184.744375 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0030 184.744375 186.355250 yeah
sw4638A-ms98-a-0031 186.355250 190.850000 yeah and also i think that they can get off on too many technicalities
sw4638A-ms98-a-0032 190.850000 202.041250 i think that it turns out sometimes that the victims are the ones that have to defend themselves rather than the criminals and i think that's another thing that needs to be addressed too
sw4638A-ms98-a-0033 202.041250 205.094500 i think you have mu[ch]- many rights as a victim
sw4638A-ms98-a-0034 205.094500 224.230750 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0035 224.230750 225.655250 right
sw4638A-ms98-a-0036 225.655250 234.330625 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0037 234.330625 235.797250 um-hum
sw4638A-ms98-a-0038 235.797250 241.711250 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0039 241.711250 243.333250 yeah i think so and
sw4638A-ms98-a-0040 243.333250 258.243375 i don't know i i've been through a two year divorce recently and i find that the system sucks to put it bluntly and so you know [laughter] i just i don't have a lot of respect anymore for what i thought you know would be fair you just figure oh well the judge will be fair well
sw4638A-ms98-a-0041 258.243375 264.908875 forget it [laughter] you know it's no[t]- it doesn't happen they're in a hurry their docket is full they want you in they want you out
sw4638A-ms98-a-0042 264.908875 267.502750 and that's the way it is and so
sw4638A-ms98-a-0043 267.502750 268.568625 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0044 268.568625 270.825500 um-hum um-hum
sw4638A-ms98-a-0045 270.825500 276.863875 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0046 276.863875 278.296250 yeah [noise]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0047 278.296250 279.351000 yeah
sw4638A-ms98-a-0048 279.351000 281.267000 [silence]
sw4638A-ms98-a-0049 281.267000 290.547500 so i don't know but i don't know how you and i can solve this [laughter] that's the problem you know we all have ideas but nothing seems to change
sw4638A-ms98-a-0050 290.547500 293.517250 and i'm not sure how it can
sw4638A-ms98-a-0051 293.517250 298.402000 [silence]
