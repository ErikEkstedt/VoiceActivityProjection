sw4684B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.082000 [noise]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0002 0.082000 8.711125 yeah uh so the thing is i traveled to uh i traveled all over uh South America a few years ago when i was in college and uh
sw4684B-ms98-a-0003 8.711125 15.008625 picked up a lot of history and uh and uh a lot of cultural knowledge from that experience
sw4684B-ms98-a-0004 15.008625 20.345375 uh have you had any experience with it or have you read or have you any interest in it
sw4684B-ms98-a-0005 20.345375 32.554750 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0006 32.554750 42.828125 well it was interesting for me i hadn't taken much uh history or any classes or anything on it at school and uh the person i was traveling with knew a lot about it
sw4684B-ms98-a-0007 42.828125 50.253625 uh and she kind of explained [noise] a lot of things that were going on there but uh uh it was interesting to to see
sw4684B-ms98-a-0008 50.253625 58.308875 a lot of uh the history and how they've sort of developed into some of the patterns that each of the countries have been through when i was traveling around down there
sw4684B-ms98-a-0009 58.308875 76.194125 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0010 76.194125 77.501000 uh-huh
sw4684B-ms98-a-0011 77.501000 99.461000 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0012 99.461000 105.056500 yeah i think that uh i think that particularly applies down there uh
sw4684B-ms98-a-0013 105.056500 117.858750 i[t]- uh there was a perception particularly in Brazil and Argentina that the United States had was really to blame for a lot of the economic oppression that was suffered down there
sw4684B-ms98-a-0014 117.858750 129.011875 because uh something like after the war we gave all sorts of special trade preferences to Europe to help them recover and completely ignored the South American beef and
sw4684B-ms98-a-0015 129.011875 141.600250 and what other industry they had down there and they suffered greatly for that even though they had these great products for export you it was sort of the United States that was kind of choosing their fate you know who would make it and who wouldn't
sw4684B-ms98-a-0016 141.600250 177.446875 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0017 177.446875 178.570500 yeah
sw4684B-ms98-a-0018 178.570500 198.398875 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0019 198.398875 199.645750 yeah
sw4684B-ms98-a-0020 199.645750 220.096875 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0021 220.096875 221.370000 huh
sw4684B-ms98-a-0022 221.370000 222.587875 yeah
sw4684B-ms98-a-0023 222.587875 243.586875 [silence]
sw4684B-ms98-a-0024 243.586875 250.363375 yeah uh in fact a lot of those same sort of stereotypes impressions i had before i traveled around
sw4684B-ms98-a-0025 250.363375 259.124500 down there and one of the things i learned was that there is an incredible amount of diversity uh especially from country to country but even within countries
sw4684B-ms98-a-0026 259.124500 265.842750 you know you you've got uh uh different races uh in in the Andean countries you have a big
sw4684B-ms98-a-0027 265.842750 276.467125 uh Indian race you know an[d]- and Mexico has a lot of that and that's why you know you get sort of the Spanish Mexicans who who aren't really as common that you see in the United States and
sw4684B-ms98-a-0028 276.467125 288.232750 and the uh the the poor uh ethnic uh you know Indian uh uh races and cultures and everything and there's a there's a big mixture and then like Brazil has
sw4684B-ms98-a-0029 288.232750 300.066000 uh a lot of Af[rican]- people of African descent and all different races and [noise] and then you you deal with a lot of issues that are sort of even a microcosm of of the racial issues in the United States where like people in Argentina
