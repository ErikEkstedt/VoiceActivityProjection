sw4643A-ms98-a-0031 181.827125 185.396250 and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred and twenty dollars
sw4643A-ms98-a-0032 185.396250 192.800125 it took me a lot of time but it didn't but if it cost me twenty dollars you know and then i [noise]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0033 192.800125 201.165250 yeah then i saw a one of these country looking wood watermelons it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it
sw4643A-ms98-a-0034 201.165250 203.063250 [silence]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0035 203.063250 205.865625 oh yeah uh-huh
sw4643A-ms98-a-0036 205.865625 210.234375 i went there we have Home Depot out here i don't know if you've heard of it i went and i got
sw4643A-ms98-a-0037 210.234375 222.730000 two six foot inch thick boards turned into watermelon i had to cut it into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lathe and cutting that wedge out was no [laughter-joke]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0038 222.730000 227.574750 [laughter] we did it on a w[e]- i had a uh i did it through Adult Ed again
sw4643A-ms98-a-0039 227.574750 229.629250 i did it through Adult Ed again
sw4643A-ms98-a-0040 229.629250 239.986625 and the teacher [laughter-was] one of these negative people oh that's dangerous we can't do that we just can't do that and i was going well how about this way i- h[ow]- i'm wanna do that that was the plan [laughter-here] [noise]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0041 239.986625 243.444500 so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of
sw4643A-ms98-a-0042 243.444500 245.793125 a cradle for it
sw4643A-ms98-a-0043 245.793125 247.647250 [silence]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0044 247.647250 252.796750 well it the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw
sw4643A-ms98-a-0045 252.796750 263.371625 but there's no coping saw big enough to for a fourteen inch wide [laughter-watermelon] the[re]- and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular s[aw]- i said i'm not that steady it's not gonna [laughter-happen]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0046 263.371625 270.962250 so we built a cradle for it and we got th[e]- once it was turned we got one [vocalized-noise] one cut out on the table saw
sw4643A-ms98-a-0047 270.962250 280.686375 on the radial saw by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think [laughter-about] so
sw4643A-ms98-a-0048 280.686375 281.832500 [silence]
sw4643A-ms98-a-0049 281.832500 286.263375 um i'd say it's about an eighth you know just
