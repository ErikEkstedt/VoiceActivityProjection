sw4611B-ms98-a-0002 0.332000 1.404375 hi
sw4611B-ms98-a-0003 1.404375 4.582125 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0004 4.582125 5.887875 uh-huh
sw4611B-ms98-a-0005 5.887875 14.320125 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0006 14.320125 15.751375 [laughter]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0007 15.751375 30.950875 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0008 30.950875 33.069875 any particular reason [noise]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0009 33.069875 60.277000 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0010 60.277000 61.550125 uh-huh
sw4611B-ms98-a-0011 61.550125 69.728125 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0012 69.728125 70.894750 uh-huh
sw4611B-ms98-a-0013 70.894750 85.594500 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0014 85.594500 93.156750 i really don't i mean i i like to refer to this as sort of Consumer Report phenomenon which is everybody that i know
sw4611B-ms98-a-0015 93.156750 106.101625 reads Consumer Reports so the people who do feel that Consumer Reports does a a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest but assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas
sw4611B-ms98-a-0016 106.101625 113.196625 uh without thinking that there were people in who think each other areas area of of specialty and
sw4611B-ms98-a-0017 113.196625 120.925375 uh i guess you could explain it two ways and and the cynical view is [noise] well these things aren't doing a very good job at all
sw4611B-ms98-a-0018 120.925375 124.607000 and the view that i'd [laughter-rather] take is that 
sw4611B-ms98-a-0019 124.607000 137.654500 there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or uh particularly interested in buying something as a you know as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things
sw4611B-ms98-a-0020 137.654500 150.093500 and i think the same thing is true with news if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on most papers a[nd]- and especially the better papers the the Times the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post give you a reasonable idea
sw4611B-ms98-a-0021 150.093500 163.984875 if you were deeply involved in it then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know that much
sw4611B-ms98-a-0022 163.984875 173.900500 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0023 173.900500 178.482875 well i mean there's there's a reasonable question as to
sw4611B-ms98-a-0024 178.482875 182.905375 whether it's worth the amount of time it [laughter-takes] to keep up on things
sw4611B-ms98-a-0025 182.905375 190.171875 and most people think it is and i can i can you know accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it
sw4611B-ms98-a-0026 190.171875 193.745500 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0027 193.745500 202.577250 i don't think it's that high i know a lot of people who may [noise] watch the TV news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper
sw4611B-ms98-a-0028 202.577250 209.153875 and i think they're saying well if something's really important i'll at least find out that it happened
sw4611B-ms98-a-0029 209.153875 217.866000 and and that's a that's is a reasonable start and for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked
sw4611B-ms98-a-0030 217.866000 227.072625 um and if something important happened it was covered on TV and i could then go and and pick up newspapers if if it were important enough to read about
sw4611B-ms98-a-0031 227.072625 235.522375 and i imagine you get the same level of thing that if {somethings} that you cared about happened you'd find out from friends or other channels [laughter]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0032 235.522375 246.842625 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0033 246.842625 249.322125 Clarence Thomas or
sw4611B-ms98-a-0034 249.322125 250.962000 right
sw4611B-ms98-a-0035 250.962000 255.068250 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0036 255.068250 256.306125 uh-huh
sw4611B-ms98-a-0037 256.306125 278.357375 [silence]
sw4611B-ms98-a-0038 278.357375 291.810500 yeah i stayed [laughter-as] [laughter-far] [laughter-away] [laughter-from] [laughter-those] as i could i decided i didn't want to waste the time i had i guess five years ago now wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings and afterwards decided that
sw4611B-ms98-a-0039 291.810500 299.842000 what i had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time i put in and that these things are just very slow [laughter-ways] [laughter-of] seeing information come out think
