sw4640A-ms98-a-0017 95.848000 101.246750 well you know i- i think you know to some extent you know people get the government they deserve is a cliche
sw4640A-ms98-a-0018 101.246750 103.625375 but it it's really true i mean if
sw4640A-ms98-a-0019 103.625375 112.191375 you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election i've heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really f[inding]- saying okay we're getting out because it's too much heat
sw4640A-ms98-a-0020 112.191375 122.498000 i mean normally it's yeah okay what big scandal but it comes times to reelect them they say hey this is the guy that brings home the bacon for us you know he's got seniority on all these committees we're not gonna replace him
sw4640A-ms98-a-0021 122.498000 131.689500 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0022 131.689500 143.193625 yeah and i mean also you know you look i think a lot of it has to do with ref[orm]- with with with the issue of campaign reform when it costs you i mean ten million twenty million dollars
sw4640A-ms98-a-0023 143.193625 147.451500 someti[mes]- i've heard horrendous figures to run for a Senate seat
sw4640A-ms98-a-0024 147.451500 151.087000 you know [vocalized-noise] job pays a hundred thousand a year
sw4640A-ms98-a-0025 151.087000 156.471250 you know i[t]- i[t]- it the you work it out unless someone is incredibly altruistic
sw4640A-ms98-a-0026 156.471250 159.500500 you know there's no reason for them to want to run for that
sw4640A-ms98-a-0027 159.500500 193.447000 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0028 193.447000 194.729500 right
sw4640A-ms98-a-0029 194.729500 204.007875 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0030 204.007875 207.483875 [vocalized-noise] it's an imperfect system because people are imperfect
sw4640A-ms98-a-0031 207.483875 213.313125 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0032 213.313125 215.995625 i- i mean the problem is that
sw4640A-ms98-a-0033 215.995625 217.548000 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0034 217.548000 227.557250 you know you've got as i said there's no incen[tive]- incentive to go into [vocalized-noise] look at our state legislature and things where very nominal pay but there's also not you know 
sw4640A-ms98-a-0035 227.557250 232.076750 what's the campaign the campaign is four guys go against each other and you know there's no advertising
sw4640A-ms98-a-0036 232.076750 235.896500 those people i can believe are doing it because they want to change the process
sw4640A-ms98-a-0037 235.896500 239.496750 but when you're talking about having to spend tens of millions of dollars
sw4640A-ms98-a-0038 239.496750 249.541375 to get elected and then being in the pockets of all these people who gave you the money and then having to regard how to rep[ay]- you know how to uh kind of do for yourself
sw4640A-ms98-a-0039 249.541375 257.475375 i think i- i really think that it's not so much that corrupt people go into it as that the process corrupts
sw4640A-ms98-a-0040 257.475375 278.530500 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0041 278.530500 280.926625 i- i think it depends a lot on
sw4640A-ms98-a-0042 280.926625 284.794250 on the state i think that it varies from state to state
sw4640A-ms98-a-0043 284.794250 289.176375 [silence]
sw4640A-ms98-a-0044 289.176375 290.515500 [vocalized-noise]
