sw4640B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.617125 [noise]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0002 0.617125 21.104375 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0003 21.104375 22.463500 well
sw4640B-ms98-a-0004 22.463500 23.498500 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0005 23.498500 33.655875 it's for me it's hard to talk about uh specifics because i don't know the people all i've read is uh the headlines the uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0006 33.655875 38.194625 the generic question which is what they're talking about i think it's
sw4640B-ms98-a-0007 38.194625 45.438875 all government any government is based on the honesty of the of the individual right
sw4640B-ms98-a-0008 45.438875 63.059500 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0009 63.059500 72.087750 yeah well that's that's part of it the tradition certainly modifies it if you have uh tradition of of um like
sw4640B-ms98-a-0010 72.087750 76.110000 yeah or might makes right or money and which is might
sw4640B-ms98-a-0011 76.110000 81.920000 so uh i[n]- certainly you're not going to have the same kind of honesty on the other hand uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0012 81.920000 87.512375 i- i- i think it seems to me that all the big scandals are based on either
sw4640B-ms98-a-0013 87.512375 91.997625 individual honesty uh going corrupt or frankly uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0014 91.997625 95.552875 uh elective honesty going bad on us
sw4640B-ms98-a-0015 95.552875 100.586625 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0016 100.586625 101.908125 yeah
sw4640B-ms98-a-0017 101.908125 122.682500 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0018 122.682500 132.422375 yes and that's again the what you said earlier about people get what they deserve they say well i[f]- if if a dishonest person is uh good for us we'll keep him in office
sw4640B-ms98-a-0019 132.422375 160.581750 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0020 160.581750 166.486500 i- i think that uh part of it again is this this uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0021 166.486500 167.648375 [vocalized-noise]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0022 167.648375 179.701125 well organizations can go bad and our particular organization has is one of the best in the world but it's still relative to itself is uh is in serious need of reform
sw4640B-ms98-a-0023 179.701125 181.210500 um
sw4640B-ms98-a-0024 181.210500 184.753125 i['ve]- i've been overseas and
sw4640B-ms98-a-0025 184.753125 193.300750 there's a lot of as you pointed out there's a lot of corrup[tion]- corruption in other countries and so when you come back to the States you say well as bad as this is 
sw4640B-ms98-a-0026 193.300750 205.211750 i'm still awfully glad to be here uh so i guess the you [laughter-know] this this question was can we ever get uh totally uh honest government and i would say uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0027 205.211750 206.673750 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0028 206.673750 211.151875 yeah only to the extent that i'm honest can i can i uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0029 211.151875 213.555000 uh act as an honest person
sw4640B-ms98-a-0030 213.555000 256.477250 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0031 256.477250 265.650500 i- i i would agree with you there well the other side of the coin too is tha[t]- that the whole that the process even from the beginning uh
sw4640B-ms98-a-0032 265.650500 277.977375 you scratch my back i'll scratch yours uh i would even i would disagree with you a little bit because i think that in the state level that's just part of the uh the internship so to speak and there's a lot of corruption 
sw4640B-ms98-a-0033 277.977375 283.557000 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0034 283.557000 291.952250 oh yes but but what i meant was why do people go why do people run for the school board because that's step one on the ladder
sw4640B-ms98-a-0035 291.952250 292.989500 [silence]
sw4640B-ms98-a-0036 292.989500 297.510750 [laughter]
