sw4633A-ms98-a-0011 40.559375 49.815375 i think you're right because i was an only child too and that's one reason i have so many [laughter] because i really i enjoyed the big family
sw4633A-ms98-a-0012 49.815375 60.236250 and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters and so she's sort of like an only child and it's the same type of thing um
sw4633A-ms98-a-0013 60.236250 63.715000 [silence]
sw4633A-ms98-a-0014 63.715000 65.138000 uh-huh

sw4633A-ms98-a-0018 70.627625 81.718875 right that's exactly how it is you know she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her when things don't go [laughter-right] she just calls one of them [laughter-you] [laughter-know] but um
sw4633A-ms98-a-0019 81.718875 90.108625 yeah it's it's a little bit difficult though i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more and
sw4633A-ms98-a-0020 90.108625 93.030625 [silence]
sw4633A-ms98-a-0021 93.030625 101.751375 we we really did not my next oldest daughter that's in college in California is a world twirling champion she twirls a baton
sw4633A-ms98-a-0022 101.751375 112.552750 and we did a lot of things together she and i did a lot of things together and flew we've flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
sw4633A-ms98-a-0023 112.552750 121.788375 and that was a lot of fun but that that i guess you could consider that organized i mean there's a competition all the time we were very heavy into that
sw4633A-ms98-a-0024 121.788375 129.588125 other than that they were pretty much and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
sw4633A-ms98-a-0025 129.588125 138.063750 [silence]

sw4633A-ms98-a-0035 166.307375 177.667750 yeah well i know i spent hours in the gym everyday with my daughter and my little one also competed because really she had no choice she had to go with me
sw4633A-ms98-a-0036 177.667750 188.824000 so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and and competing and of course the competing itself really didn't matter what it was it was making the friends and going all the places and
sw4633A-ms98-a-0037 188.824000 197.693125 it was a really neat experience but it took our total time i did not work um when i did this now i do work full time
sw4633A-ms98-a-0038 197.693125 208.653500 and it's just my thirteen year old and myself and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
