sw4633B-ms98-a-0026 129.095125 143.696875 you know i think that's probably true the [noise] if you have one child or fewer you get involved in organized events or activities and if you have a large number of children or then you don't
sw4633B-ms98-a-0027 143.696875 151.359625 no you c[an't]- and there's not enough time um like my son is in uh Little League this year he's ten
sw4633B-ms98-a-0028 151.359625 160.850375 and they practice three times a week and they have a game and it's just uh if there were more than one child i don't know there there would be no way to do it
sw4633B-ms98-a-0029 160.850375 164.842875 you know one parent go in one direction and i'd have to go in the other and

sw4633B-ms98-a-0036 208.541375 217.432125 i don't think although [vocalized-noise] i think a a more than one child probably three children is probably the ideal to me
sw4633B-ms98-a-0037 217.432125 223.838500 but i'm not sure i could afford three i most certainly couldn't educate three [noise] i don't know how my my parents did it
sw4633B-ms98-a-0038 223.838500 235.657125 i mean there were five of us i don't recall you know wanting anything in particular uh but i don't know how my father did it he worked at a truck line and
sw4633B-ms98-a-0039 235.657125 247.676875 he just didn't make that kind of money with five children but we did okay we had a house and a home and but now my wife and i both work and we don't i don't believe we have as much as my parents did
sw4633B-ms98-a-0040 247.676875 249.918750 and we only have one child

sw4633B-ms98-a-0046 270.148750 280.348875 wha[t]- and they you know the housing so cheap in comparison to Boston that they jump on it they sell their house they stash away a good bit of money
sw4633B-ms98-a-0047 280.348875 288.860250 and come down here and i work with a lot of them_1 they they think they they've really done something then when they get down here they realize the cost of living is outrageous
