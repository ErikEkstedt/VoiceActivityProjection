sw4628B-ms98-a-0002 0.520125 4.017500 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0003 4.017500 8.899000 uh i work for Georgia Tech yes sir i work for the research facility
sw4628B-ms98-a-0004 8.899000 19.137875 um and it's it's kind of small in a sense but it it does have about uh i guess two thousand civil employees
sw4628B-ms98-a-0005 19.137875 26.899500 and on a a scale i guess it's still considered small it just have a lot of different laboratories
sw4628B-ms98-a-0006 26.899500 33.469000 the area i work in it it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so
sw4628B-ms98-a-0007 33.469000 38.210750 so that's make up most of the laboratory
sw4628B-ms98-a-0008 38.210750 45.553875 so from from that standpoint it's pretty small it's pretty small what about yourself
sw4628B-ms98-a-0009 45.553875 50.462875 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0010 50.462875 52.387250 oh okay
sw4628B-ms98-a-0011 52.387250 55.357125 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0012 55.357125 57.127875 oh okay
sw4628B-ms98-a-0013 57.127875 58.007375 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0014 58.007375 59.113000 yes 
sw4628B-ms98-a-0015 59.113000 63.799375 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0016 63.799375 65.577500 oh okay
sw4628B-ms98-a-0017 65.577500 66.941625 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0018 66.941625 68.434500 right
sw4628B-ms98-a-0019 68.434500 69.627500 uh
sw4628B-ms98-a-0020 69.627500 87.548375 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0021 87.548375 88.843875 um-hum
sw4628B-ms98-a-0022 88.843875 90.661500 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0023 90.661500 92.432125 right [noise]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0024 92.432125 96.247750 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0025 96.247750 107.694250 well those and probably the security aspect of it because a lot of time nowadays even though you're working uh you're treated
sw4628B-ms98-a-0026 107.694250 114.855250 and it may not be true in every place in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a a person
sw4628B-ms98-a-0027 114.855250 119.693125 because when it come down to layoff they don't really consider people and
sw4628B-ms98-a-0028 119.693125 128.148500 and you know their well being as far as you know how they go[ing]- their next dollars gonna come in how they gonna pay them bills they just lay them_1 off
sw4628B-ms98-a-0029 128.148500 132.404000 and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had
sw4628B-ms98-a-0030 132.404000 137.753125 uh i think the company still exists what they used to do is they used to
sw4628B-ms98-a-0031 137.753125 143.026125 cut the number of hours for everybody as [noise] opposed to just laying people off
sw4628B-ms98-a-0032 143.026125 149.510625 you know that way that you know one person wouldn't get one big blunt [flow/blow] at one time
sw4628B-ms98-a-0033 149.510625 155.610875 and uh you know i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people
sw4628B-ms98-a-0034 155.610875 164.230125 that do get laid off a little bit better you know other than s[omething]- you know something like unemployment is good but i mean the company as a whole because
sw4628B-ms98-a-0035 164.230125 167.495000 you as an employee even though the company
sw4628B-ms98-a-0036 167.495000 178.898500 is making money they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth you're responsible also for helping that company get to the [par[t]-/point] point that it's at at making profits
sw4628B-ms98-a-0037 178.898500 181.576875 so there should be something
sw4628B-ms98-a-0038 181.576875 182.585750 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0039 182.585750 193.243750 in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than you know uh neglect or something like that
sw4628B-ms98-a-0040 193.243750 200.115000 you know because it's not a person's fault that you know people not buying or [binesses/businesses] are
sw4628B-ms98-a-0041 200.115000 213.327250 are not on the up and up all the time you know i don't see how one or two people maybe more one or two but you know a number of people can can be the downfall of company a company situation
sw4628B-ms98-a-0042 213.327250 214.866250 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0043 214.866250 223.865000 well in a sense that say how do you make a a conclusion that you're gonna lay off these ten people
sw4628B-ms98-a-0044 223.865000 232.898625 uh for the bad times of the company what about the the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well
sw4628B-ms98-a-0045 232.898625 235.920000 you know in that standpoint
sw4628B-ms98-a-0046 235.920000 240.803000 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0047 240.803000 245.851875 ye[s]- yes i do i really do i think it'd be better that way
sw4628B-ms98-a-0048 245.851875 255.746625 and even at that it would at least give the person time to look for another job because they know that you know that there are problems and you know
sw4628B-ms98-a-0049 255.746625 262.710875 there are reason to look for another job instead of just dumping it on them_1 all at one time
sw4628B-ms98-a-0050 262.710875 266.470375 you know that's just that's my views you know
sw4628B-ms98-a-0051 266.470375 279.660125 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0052 279.660125 281.016625 right
sw4628B-ms98-a-0053 281.016625 283.663625 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0054 283.663625 285.231625 right
sw4628B-ms98-a-0055 285.231625 287.489875 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0056 287.489875 289.055000 right
sw4628B-ms98-a-0057 289.055000 291.066375 [silence]
sw4628B-ms98-a-0058 291.066375 295.183000 well at least that would give a person a chance to look
sw4628B-ms98-a-0059 295.183000 299.074000 you know because the way it is a person really don't have a chance
