sw4661B-ms98-a-0002 0.090625 1.277125 oh
sw4661B-ms98-a-0003 1.277125 2.737750 [silence]
sw4661B-ms98-a-0004 2.737750 4.850625 well i think
sw4661B-ms98-a-0005 4.850625 12.422000 i think the biggest thing that's important is to is to learn enough about the student to match the student well to the to the school
sw4661B-ms98-a-0006 12.422000 20.868125 and one thing i learned i went undergraduate to Harvard and then came out to Berkeley and it's pretty clear that there are some people who thrive at Berkeley
sw4661B-ms98-a-0007 20.868125 32.332125 uh and there are some people who who just die here because of the the amount of support that's given and the amount of uh bureaucracy you have to deal with and other things like that
sw4661B-ms98-a-0008 32.332125 37.048250 [silence]
sw4661B-ms98-a-0009 37.048250 40.665250 uh in a large public school i think in general
sw4661B-ms98-a-0010 40.665250 45.480375 and uh this is a school with some thirty thousand students
sw4661B-ms98-a-0011 45.480375 52.841625 and it is set up in such a fashion that students register for classes months in advance and if they don't get them
sw4661B-ms98-a-0012 52.841625 67.236125 they may not get a chance to take them that year um average graduation has crept up closer and closer to five years largely because of the number of students who can't get all of the courses to fulfill their major on time
sw4661B-ms98-a-0013 67.236125 69.687500 uh on the hand this is
sw4661B-ms98-a-0014 69.687500 80.428625 it is an[d]- and it's happening in in a lot of public schools uh because of of budget cuts but on the other hand what it does provide is is for the um 
sw4661B-ms98-a-0015 80.428625 86.586875 for students who who need a chance to be forced to fend for themselves
sw4661B-ms98-a-0016 86.586875 93.154875 uh who have perhaps been too isolated this is a a case where they're they're forced to do that
sw4661B-ms98-a-0017 93.154875 100.681000 and and my wife went here as an undergraduate she had been sort of protected right through high school and and had to learn to
sw4661B-ms98-a-0018 100.681000 115.571750 to make it on her own and she graduated from the place in four years by learning to be smart and picking courses that uh at the right times and right priorities and i can see that as advantageous but there are a lot of people for whom this is just a waste of time
sw4661B-ms98-a-0019 115.571750 132.952375 [silence]

sw4661B-ms98-a-0032 180.239875 181.629625 right
sw4661B-ms98-a-0033 181.629625 205.536375 [silence]
sw4661B-ms98-a-0034 205.536375 209.815750 jus[t]- just to be able to find a job that you would qualify for
sw4661B-ms98-a-0035 209.815750 211.224625 yeah
sw4661B-ms98-a-0036 211.224625 214.711000 [silence]
sw4661B-ms98-a-0037 214.711000 215.991500 well
sw4661B-ms98-a-0038 215.991500 220.888000 i- i think one of the reasons that i don't see that as as much of a problem
sw4661B-ms98-a-0039 220.888000 231.696375 see i would encourage people to go into college not knowing what they want to do because so many of the high schools have done such a bad job at introducing different areas
sw4661B-ms98-a-0040 231.696375 246.683625 that it may be that what you want to do and it may be a very practical thing to go into doesn't seem attractive because what you've learned of it so far is is not interesting a lot of people are turned off from math because of high school math
sw4661B-ms98-a-0041 246.683625 251.251375 and going to a school that offers a lot of choice
sw4661B-ms98-a-0042 251.251375 258.095125 and taking your first year or two to explore what the choices are still gives you plenty of time and
sw4661B-ms98-a-0043 258.095125 262.051875 [silence]
sw4661B-ms98-a-0044 262.051875 269.081625 and then eventually focus on a single major i certainly wouldn't say to go to a liberal arts school that doesn't have a strong science program
sw4661B-ms98-a-0045 269.081625 278.328125 uh and i'd even encourage a liberal arts school with an engineering program but i tend to look i don't like what i see from the students who are graduating here with engineering degrees
sw4661B-ms98-a-0046 278.328125 285.568125 where seventy five or eighty percent of their time is spent in a prearranged technical curriculum
sw4661B-ms98-a-0047 285.568125 297.766500 and they are moving here towards a program where they have a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Science combined where you get a general education with guaranteed admission into an engineering degree for a Master's degree
sw4661B-ms98-a-0048 297.766500 300.386000 and that seems like a good compromise it's
