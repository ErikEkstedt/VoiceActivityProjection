sw4661A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 3.408750 [noise] have you any wisdom to offer someone picking a college
sw4661A-ms98-a-0002 3.408750 32.054250 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0003 32.054250 39.363875 are are you saying that that there's more bureaucracy et cetera at out in California at that particular school
sw4661A-ms98-a-0004 39.363875 41.047375 ah
sw4661A-ms98-a-0005 41.047375 67.857625 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0006 67.857625 70.258250 that seems so [laughter-wasteful]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0007 70.258250 115.000000 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0008 115.000000 123.394000 hum tha[t]- it's interesting you're approaching it from the [vocalized-noise] sort of administrating your education just you know trying to get the class and be there
sw4661A-ms98-a-0009 123.394000 133.883000 i was thinking in terms of um how would you advise a kid uh on how to pick his future career i- i have a son whose a freshman in high school
sw4661A-ms98-a-0010 133.883000 140.428875 and he hasn't got a clue [laughter-you] [laughter-know] what he wants to do you know he's good in math and science and he'll you know
sw4661A-ms98-a-0011 140.428875 153.457375 uh his stepdad's an engineer his father's an accountant you know he he'll probably lean toward some kind of math or science kind of thing but he's not sure what i myself graduated with an undergraduate and a Master's in art
sw4661A-ms98-a-0012 153.457375 158.542125 and i did it because it's just something i love to do and i felt that
sw4661A-ms98-a-0013 158.542125 171.083125 i'm not i'm not a Picasso so i guess i'll teach and i kind of backed myself into a career that i never ended up really using i mean now that i'm raising my kids i'm substitute teaching because the hours are so good et cetera
sw4661A-ms98-a-0014 171.083125 180.958500 but i had never given that much thought to whether i actually liked to teach you know it just seemed that well that's a practical thing you can do with art so you might as well do it
sw4661A-ms98-a-0015 180.958500 185.192000 and i guess my advice to uh kids approaching college would
sw4661A-ms98-a-0016 185.192000 198.178375 first of all do something practical because the art for me um didn't work out very practically i got out of school when the Vietnam draft evasion was going on and everybody wanted to be a teacher there were no jobs
sw4661A-ms98-a-0017 198.178375 208.228125 and i ended up taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate college graduates which it struck me as so s[ad]-
sw4661A-ms98-a-0018 208.228125 215.088750 so sad you know there's a whole bunch of college graduates who are learning how to type just to be able to to make some money
sw4661A-ms98-a-0019 215.088750 217.244375 and um
sw4661A-ms98-a-0020 217.244375 231.087000 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0021 231.087000 232.404375 hum
sw4661A-ms98-a-0022 232.404375 256.717500 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0023 256.717500 262.497125 to pick so you you're suggesting some liberal arts program where you take a smattering of everything
sw4661A-ms98-a-0024 262.497125 268.520250 [silence]
sw4661A-ms98-a-0025 268.520250 269.889625 um-hum
