sw4687A-ms98-a-0003 5.376375 9.730875 where taxes are high and services are low
sw4687A-ms98-a-0004 9.730875 18.854625 i guess i'd have to say i don't think we're getting our money's worth as far as uh the tax system is concerned i think a lot of it is going to waste
sw4687A-ms98-a-0005 18.854625 29.672500 on uh s[ervices]- services that aren't necessary and uh out-of-date ideas that just don't make sense anymore in these times
