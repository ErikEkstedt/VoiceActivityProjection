sw4629A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 4.029750 [noise] what do you think uh are we spending the right amount of money on AIDS research 
sw4629A-ms98-a-0002 4.029750 24.673875 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0003 24.673875 26.644000 yeah i
sw4629A-ms98-a-0004 26.644000 40.214250 i do believe that there [noise] i i'm like you i'm a little mixed up on the subject i think there are more people who die of heart disease in a year in this country than there are of AIDS is that true
sw4629A-ms98-a-0005 40.214250 41.843125 have you heard that
sw4629A-ms98-a-0006 41.843125 50.903375 and and i suppose really AIDS is you die from any number of things isn't that t[rue]- true
sw4629A-ms98-a-0007 50.903375 63.366500 so so i would suspect that you know pneumonia i think is one of them and and the cancers and whatnot so i think indirectly there there is extra AIDS research being done
sw4629A-ms98-a-0008 63.366500 78.213000 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0009 78.213000 88.036625 no i don't think so i [laughter] i i totally agree it's just like education throwing more money into a grade school isn't necessarily going to make things [laughter-better]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0010 88.036625 130.983500 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0011 130.983500 142.648125 yeah so i- you're thinking in terms of of an education on how to prevent it or you're thinking of maybe uh i don't know a vaccine [laughter-or]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0012 142.648125 152.570125 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0013 152.570125 154.592375 oh absolutely
sw4629A-ms98-a-0014 154.592375 191.433875 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0015 191.433875 192.617250 yeah
sw4629A-ms98-a-0016 192.617250 206.364125 yeah well do you think that one reason maybe that the the funding level is as high as it is is because AIDS perhaps strikes uh a vocal group of people
sw4629A-ms98-a-0017 206.364125 207.808875 i mean
sw4629A-ms98-a-0018 207.808875 209.739250 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0019 209.739250 218.831750 [laughter] that's right tell me about it i was in i was on a down in downtown Washington Sunday when half a million people were [laughter-demonstrating]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0020 218.831750 220.655500 [laughter]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0021 220.655500 226.055500 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0022 226.055500 228.204500 yeah well i
sw4629A-ms98-a-0023 228.204500 237.389625 i agree that there's a limited it it's almost like we have fixed number of dollars that you can spend on medical research and you have to kind of allocate it in certain directions
sw4629A-ms98-a-0024 237.389625 240.734250 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0025 240.734250 246.358250 but good things have come of that i mean polio is just about a thing of the past
sw4629A-ms98-a-0026 246.358250 250.859375 and and other diseases um [noise] [laughter]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0027 250.859375 267.576500 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0028 267.576500 270.477000 uh-huh i suspect that's true
sw4629A-ms98-a-0029 270.477000 288.594750 [silence]
sw4629A-ms98-a-0030 288.594750 294.386750 that's right well certainly if you have AIDS unless you're incredibly wealthy you're going to end up indigent
sw4629A-ms98-a-0031 294.386750 299.714000 i think that i mean that goes along with it too you get to the point where you can't work and
