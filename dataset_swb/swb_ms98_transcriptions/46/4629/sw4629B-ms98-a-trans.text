sw4629B-ms98-a-0014 65.058625 68.373500 but i think that [noise]
sw4629B-ms98-a-0015 68.373500 72.800750 a lot of people have the attitude that the more money you throw at something
sw4629B-ms98-a-0016 72.800750 78.433125 the uh better chance you have at at curing it and that's just not true

sw4629B-ms98-a-0018 88.024750 90.121000 right i think uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0019 90.121000 93.918500 you know that that money needs to be spent on on research
sw4629B-ms98-a-0020 93.918500 94.584125 [noise]
sw4629B-ms98-a-0021 94.584125 97.462625 but i i think uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0022 97.462625 99.920125 you know it should be a a
sw4629B-ms98-a-0023 99.920125 108.204000 wide spectrum re[search]- of research and not just uh you know research on a cure and not not on a research on how to
sw4629B-ms98-a-0024 108.204000 114.615875 uh prolong life or or uh make the disease any any less traumatic
sw4629B-ms98-a-0025 114.615875 121.090125 know i think money i think one once somebody has contracted the disease that's that's uh 
sw4629B-ms98-a-0026 121.090125 123.570500 you know that's unfortunate
sw4629B-ms98-a-0027 123.570500 131.433125 but let's try to concentrate on on you know let's put resources on making sure nobody else gets it

sw4629B-ms98-a-0031 141.778875 144.599000 right well i think uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0032 144.599000 153.617375 you know there's there's my opinion is there's there's a there is a limited number of resources medical resources available
sw4629B-ms98-a-0033 153.617375 158.340875 and i think it is foolish to
sw4629B-ms98-a-0034 158.340875 166.599750 to uh spend most of those uh a a large majority of those resources on people who have AIDS
sw4629B-ms98-a-0035 166.599750 180.579250 uh simply because they they uh they need attention right away or or need more attention than somebody who has heart disease or or slow cancer or something i think i don't know i think uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0036 180.579250 184.709250 too much money is being spent on on uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0037 184.709250 191.841125 on sophisticated medical treatment for for people for people who need to be in a hospice program

sw4629B-ms98-a-0053 272.023500 278.893250 you know i i you know my heart goes out to those people who who have the disease but i don't think that we should be
sw4629B-ms98-a-0054 278.893250 280.610875 spending uh
sw4629B-ms98-a-0055 280.610875 281.549250 [noise]
sw4629B-ms98-a-0056 281.549250 289.558125 you know that the that a majority of the hospitals resources should not go for for uh indigent [vocalized-noise] AIDS patients
