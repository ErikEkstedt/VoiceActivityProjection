sw4616B-ms98-a-0002 0.475500 2.428375 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0003 2.428375 6.027750 right now i think my favorite ones are Parenting and Car and Driver
sw4616B-ms98-a-0004 6.027750 7.444375 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0005 7.444375 18.406125 right i'm a grandfather so basically i'm getting interested in raising kids again and i like all the articles that uh you know the letters to the editor and like the coupons that are in most of the magazines i get
sw4616B-ms98-a-0006 18.406125 30.994125 and course Car and Driver i've got t[wo]- two teenage boys that are in the market for a car so we i've been trying to teach them how to read for what's a good deal and what's to to to get as far as insurance costs et cetera
sw4616B-ms98-a-0007 30.994125 35.636875 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0008 35.636875 48.071375 yes they have uh they compare them_1 i use the Car and Driver i knew we they mention other magazines and Consumer Reports is in our library so i don't subscribe to it because_1 of the cost i try to keep most of my magazines down
sw4616B-ms98-a-0009 48.071375 72.606500 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0010 72.606500 84.267875 [laughter] the problem i have with Newsweek and Time is i never had any time to read them but that's the reason i get magazines because it's mostly current so if i really want to be kept up current i usually get a newspaper instead of those weekly magazines
sw4616B-ms98-a-0011 84.267875 92.016875 but the Consumer Report is the magazine's the best way to go because_1 the book comes out like once a year wh[ere]- but the repair records are good to compare it
sw4616B-ms98-a-0012 92.016875 99.493625 because_1 i think right now with our budget range we're comparing like Hyundais and older model Datsuns and Toyotas and Fords
sw4616B-ms98-a-0013 99.493625 115.995000 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0014 115.995000 117.327875 so what
sw4616B-ms98-a-0015 117.327875 121.021500 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0016 121.021500 130.194250 yeah i just started getting those i guess somebody put my name in the hat or something because_1 i got my first one this month and said if you'd like to continue please fill out this card
sw4616B-ms98-a-0017 130.194250 133.502500 and i haven't even had a chance to look through it yet i just got it today
sw4616B-ms98-a-0018 133.502500 141.352625 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0019 141.352625 143.092875 so that's your favorite one
sw4616B-ms98-a-0020 143.092875 160.612125 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0021 160.612125 163.026125 so you're a home builder you're
sw4616B-ms98-a-0022 163.026125 165.008000 do you rent a home
sw4616B-ms98-a-0023 165.008000 168.636500 you own your home okay but you don't [laughter] do any repairs on it
sw4616B-ms98-a-0024 168.636500 175.577000 okay we rent but we still get to you know do repairs and do improvements and take some of that off the rent
sw4616B-ms98-a-0025 175.577000 197.653250 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0026 197.653250 204.628000 uh you run the gambit of trying different ones every year i get those American Family Publisher advertisements and that's when i make a comparison
sw4616B-ms98-a-0027 204.628000 215.190125 based on prices and stuff and then of course for home repair anything like that i wouldn't do that many projects anyway so if i do plan on building a door or fixing something i'd go to the library and start preparing for it before i did that
sw4616B-ms98-a-0028 215.190125 222.782375 and of course on the the the -[ad]van[tage]- magazines have no advantage on some of the home builder centers because_1 they have pamphlets already made up
sw4616B-ms98-a-0029 222.782375 231.098750 and you can be talking to a customer service representative while you are looking at the pamphlet where with the magazine any questions you have you write to the editor and you have to wait for the answer
sw4616B-ms98-a-0030 231.098750 233.111375 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0031 233.111375 234.346625 yeah
sw4616B-ms98-a-0032 234.346625 252.981625 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0033 252.981625 254.317375 [laughter-no]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0034 254.317375 255.441000 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0035 255.441000 259.901125 well Reader's Digest used to be good on coupons and all of a sudden they just kind of cut back on it and
sw4616B-ms98-a-0036 259.901125 262.879750 for the price anymore i don't think they're worth it
sw4616B-ms98-a-0037 262.879750 265.715500 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0038 265.715500 268.839125 yeah i stopped doing that a long time ago
sw4616B-ms98-a-0039 268.839125 272.406750 oh and i confess i've got one other magazine TV Guide
sw4616B-ms98-a-0040 272.406750 275.415250 every week i've got to have my TV Guide
sw4616B-ms98-a-0041 275.415250 281.011250 the newspaper just doesn't do it justice when i wanna read my favorite section in that is Cheers and Jeers
sw4616B-ms98-a-0042 281.011250 289.086875 [silence]
sw4616B-ms98-a-0043 289.086875 298.946000 they're pretty good i sold them_1 as a kid for fifteen cents each got four cents each more than i sold now they're up to eighty nine cents each which isn't too bad if you have them_1 delivered to the home
