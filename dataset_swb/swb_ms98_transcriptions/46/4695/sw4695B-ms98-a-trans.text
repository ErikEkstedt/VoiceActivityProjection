sw4695B-ms98-a-0006 7.911125 14.723375 uh was an only child but her family all through her adolescence had a uh small pull behind trailer
sw4695B-ms98-a-0007 14.723375 28.497500 so they didn't go out necessarily camping in tents and such but they did a lot of weekend um trips all through the midwest and the east uh Lancaster Pennsylvania and so forth and so on they did a lot of traveling with that so
sw4695B-ms98-a-0008 28.497500 35.634250 if you count that as camping which may some people may or may not um she had a lot of experience with that and

sw4695B-ms98-a-0030 125.735000 131.603750 i guess my kid you know my kids go to the YM um or go to the uh girl scout camp
sw4695B-ms98-a-0031 131.603750 138.108500 uh there are several of them_1 here in southwest Ohio that are all run by the same uh council
sw4695B-ms98-a-0032 138.108500 147.527500 and they're usually there for a week each during the summer at some point so they're they do a lot more rustic camping but m[ost]- most of their meals are served in the mess hall
sw4695B-ms98-a-0033 147.527500 151.544625 i think they have one or two outings where they cook at the campsite
sw4695B-ms98-a-0034 151.544625 160.619125 um out in the fringes of the uh of the park rather than uh than at the than at the um mess hall so they get some of it
sw4695B-ms98-a-0035 160.619125 166.784375 the only other opportunity really that i get anything like that is uh in the summer um
sw4695B-ms98-a-0036 166.784375 170.635875 i'm a ham radio operator and
sw4695B-ms98-a-0037 170.635875 175.383750 oh can't wait uh like a pilgrimage to Mecca
sw4695B-ms98-a-0038 175.383750 179.820125 but i[t's]- and it's very convenient for me because_1 it's only forty five minutes up the road
sw4695B-ms98-a-0039 179.820125 189.718500 but um for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham it know it's it's it's a couple of things it's supposed to be a uh a demonstration of how 
sw4695B-ms98-a-0040 189.718500 197.216875 the ham community can be mobilized to to operate under simulated emergency or field conditions
sw4695B-ms98-a-0041 197.216875 199.646500 [silence]
sw4695B-ms98-a-0042 199.646500 211.156125 yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever -[de]pending on how energetic the club is but uh
sw4695B-ms98-a-0043 211.156125 217.303000 you know it it's also a contest see how many other ham stations you can contact who are doing the same thing
sw4695B-ms98-a-0044 217.303000 221.514750 and then it's also a chance to get out with your buddies and drink beer and play radio all night
sw4695B-ms98-a-0045 221.514750 228.218500 or if if you you know we have a number of women in the club also but i[t's]- you know it's a chance to get out with your friends and drink beer and play radio all night
sw4695B-ms98-a-0046 228.218500 239.895875 but we do go out to one of the local city city municipal whatever parks um here in Cincinnati and uh you know go up on top of a tall hill and string some wires up in the trees and such and
sw4695B-ms98-a-0047 239.895875 252.843625 um put out the picnic tables and uh lawn chairs and set up the equipment with a generator and set up a tent for the kids to sleep in or for the people who are who are uh taking a break to to go off and sleep in
sw4695B-ms98-a-0048 252.843625 255.018750 and then use propane
sw4695B-ms98-a-0049 255.018750 262.570500 stove to cook breakfast at six o'clock the next morning with and that's about as close to camping as i really have much of a chance to get right now
