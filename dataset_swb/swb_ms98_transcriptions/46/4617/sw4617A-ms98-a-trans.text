sw4617A-ms98-a-0007 19.570000 22.951500 uh-huh you have to say that um
sw4617A-ms98-a-0008 22.951500 27.699250 i don't know the the things they asked to talk about were whether the uh
sw4617A-ms98-a-0009 27.699250 38.669250 whether the judge should be the one that does the uh sentencing and seems to me that that's i think that's the way it's done now uh at least
sw4617A-ms98-a-0010 38.669250 42.899625 my understanding of the law which isn't very good uh
sw4617A-ms98-a-0011 42.899625 49.041000 it seems to me that the judge does it and i- i think that's probably all right in that they
sw4617A-ms98-a-0012 49.041000 52.072875 you know maybe know what the
sw4617A-ms98-a-0013 52.072875 56.043000 the norm is for a particular thing
sw4617A-ms98-a-0014 56.043000 57.719375 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0015 57.719375 59.224625 right

sw4617A-ms98-a-0017 64.447000 66.180000 uh-huh
sw4617A-ms98-a-0018 66.180000 74.418625 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0019 74.418625 76.116125 that's right
sw4617A-ms98-a-0020 76.116125 78.243625 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0021 78.243625 87.554500 and i think that may i that may be an exception as well because_1 i think that doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than than the judge
sw4617A-ms98-a-0022 87.554500 89.540750 yeah
sw4617A-ms98-a-0023 89.540750 99.744125 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0024 99.744125 105.926125 yes in fact they're going to execute somebody at the end of this month and uh
sw4617A-ms98-a-0025 105.926125 115.709000 there's a big uproar going on right now uh the uh Governor you know has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not
sw4617A-ms98-a-0026 115.709000 123.497000 it was someone who had uh killed two teenage boys here in San Diego as a matter of fact
sw4617A-ms98-a-0027 123.497000 125.465750 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0028 125.465750 126.861375 yeah

sw4617A-ms98-a-0034 163.320500 168.911000 yeah i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years
sw4617A-ms98-a-0035 168.911000 177.552000 but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and you'd hate to be one of those
sw4617A-ms98-a-0036 177.552000 181.950375 the other thing they asked about was whether uh
sw4617A-ms98-a-0037 181.950375 195.934250 uh the verdict should be required to be unanimous which again i think is the way it is now that all that all verdicts well maybe not i don't know at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be unanimous
sw4617A-ms98-a-0038 195.934250 201.047750 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0039 201.047750 202.697125 uh-huh

sw4617A-ms98-a-0042 221.163375 226.801125 and uh they've only deliberated four hours or something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked
sw4617A-ms98-a-0043 226.801125 231.252500 judge told [laughter-them_1] they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet [laughter]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0044 231.252500 235.115750 [silence]

sw4617A-ms98-a-0046 239.162125 246.956375 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0047 246.956375 253.516250 maybe they could go with a with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their uh vote
sw4617A-ms98-a-0048 253.516250 257.368625 [silence]
sw4617A-ms98-a-0049 257.368625 258.978000 right
