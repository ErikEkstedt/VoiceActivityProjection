sw4646B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.349625 [noise]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0002 5.349625 12.397125 no but i my grandparents were looking into it before so i know what they've said
sw4646B-ms98-a-0003 12.397125 13.961375 um-hum [noise]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0004 13.961375 41.157500 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0005 41.157500 44.008375 oh they thought it was too much of a bother
sw4646B-ms98-a-0006 44.008375 56.261250 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0007 56.261250 57.771125 right
sw4646B-ms98-a-0008 57.771125 67.833750 if they're equipped too to handle the kind of patients you're gonna have you know to put in there too because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still
sw4646B-ms98-a-0009 67.833750 71.124250 they wanted someplace they can go and have their meals and
sw4646B-ms98-a-0010 71.124250 76.585125 a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well
sw4646B-ms98-a-0011 76.585125 78.383625 have their own room
sw4646B-ms98-a-0012 78.383625 100.737750 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0013 100.737750 102.538875 um-hum
sw4646B-ms98-a-0014 102.538875 141.793125 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0015 141.793125 150.544875 well a lot of that's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help they need health care so they're already ill before they go
sw4646B-ms98-a-0016 150.544875 151.586000 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0017 151.586000 153.915125 that's probably a large factor
sw4646B-ms98-a-0018 153.915125 162.213375 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0019 162.213375 163.635000 um-hum
sw4646B-ms98-a-0020 163.635000 165.557750 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0021 165.557750 167.818875 right right
sw4646B-ms98-a-0022 167.818875 171.427625 that's my grandparents it was just so that
sw4646B-ms98-a-0023 171.427625 177.438875 the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
sw4646B-ms98-a-0024 177.438875 183.716250 so that was their thinking somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency
sw4646B-ms98-a-0025 183.716250 184.723375 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0026 184.723375 189.923250 and also so they could find someplace they enjoyed while they still had
sw4646B-ms98-a-0027 189.923250 199.755625 choices to make so they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time i guess that's a problem too for people wait lists
sw4646B-ms98-a-0028 199.755625 206.137625 and all that um you can't always get in when you want to and of course you can't just sit around and wait
sw4646B-ms98-a-0029 206.137625 207.525125 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0030 207.525125 213.165625 yeah and the money is also another issue how you're gonna pay for it
sw4646B-ms98-a-0031 213.165625 217.281875 at that stage of life you only have so much money left and
sw4646B-ms98-a-0032 217.281875 227.523750 i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put in their savings i mean it is kind of fair but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise
sw4646B-ms98-a-0033 227.523750 229.856000 so that's another problem
sw4646B-ms98-a-0034 229.856000 237.919875 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0035 237.919875 240.145875 right right
sw4646B-ms98-a-0036 240.145875 251.538875 so it's it's just so complicated anymore i think people outlive their savings and with medicine being the way it is you're extending life
sw4646B-ms98-a-0037 251.538875 258.561125 where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore
sw4646B-ms98-a-0038 258.561125 267.605125 [silence]
sw4646B-ms98-a-0039 267.605125 277.887625 it's just a shame that's the way it has to be i think the retirement home idea's a nice idea to go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and
sw4646B-ms98-a-0040 277.887625 286.478750 because_1 uh like if your spouse died all of a sudden you be all alone it'd be nice to go someplace people similar to you and have friends
sw4646B-ms98-a-0041 286.478750 297.634000 [silence]
