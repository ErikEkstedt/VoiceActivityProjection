sw4646A-ms98-a-0005 14.052125 17.101875 [noise] well i'm trying to think my uh

sw4646A-ms98-a-0007 28.952125 30.189000 [silence]
sw4646A-ms98-a-0008 30.189000 35.544250 they when they put her in she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and
sw4646A-ms98-a-0009 35.544250 47.789250 take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean sh[e]- she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her
sw4646A-ms98-a-0010 47.789250 57.685500 so i guess you need to uh know whether it's a you know no deposit no return kind of thing whether [noise]
sw4646A-ms98-a-0011 57.685500 61.809250 [silence]
sw4646A-ms98-a-0012 61.809250 63.295875 yeah
sw4646A-ms98-a-0013 63.295875 67.345125 [silence]
sw4646A-ms98-a-0014 67.345125 68.733750 right
sw4646A-ms98-a-0015 68.733750 75.893375 [silence]
sw4646A-ms98-a-0016 75.893375 77.747375 right
sw4646A-ms98-a-0017 77.747375 85.177250 [noise] my grandmother actually was in a a nursing home that um there was a retirement hotel and then a uh
sw4646A-ms98-a-0018 85.177250 92.135875 there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for
sw4646A-ms98-a-0019 92.135875 101.337125 um the first few years she had her own apartment and you know made her own meals sometimes but could could also go and eat someplace else
sw4646A-ms98-a-0020 101.337125 111.199000 and then um as she became less able to take care of herself then she moved into this other part that was able to
sw4646A-ms98-a-0021 111.199000 117.455000 um provide full-time care and um she didn't have to do anything anymore
sw4646A-ms98-a-0022 117.455000 125.246250 but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly and that's
sw4646A-ms98-a-0023 125.246250 131.733750 some i don't know whether that's because they you know sort of give up hope once they get in there or
sw4646A-ms98-a-0024 131.733750 141.755250 what the what the reason is but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something
sw4646A-ms98-a-0025 141.755250 145.898250 [silence]

sw4646A-ms98-a-0030 152.160250 153.283875 yeah if
sw4646A-ms98-a-0031 153.283875 158.417375 if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you then you
sw4646A-ms98-a-0032 158.417375 163.064250 stay where you are and then you only go there as a last resort
sw4646A-ms98-a-0033 163.064250 166.315125 or people send you there as a last resort

sw4646A-ms98-a-0053 230.670000 238.507000 and you probably if it were you you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price

sw4646A-ms98-a-0056 259.413500 267.776750 well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing
