sw4641B-ms98-a-0004 18.035625 22.358500 well i think that i'm self-employed and work in radio
sw4641B-ms98-a-0005 22.358500 31.994250 and uh for me really i don't have to be terribly concerned about uh benefits outside because_1 i own my own company
sw4641B-ms98-a-0006 31.994250 43.228875 but uh the worst problem that i think uh out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days
sw4641B-ms98-a-0007 43.228875 46.420375 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0008 46.420375 48.204000 yeah it['s]-
sw4641B-ms98-a-0009 48.204000 55.975125 well it it's a real problem out here because uh you know it's hard to imagine that you know ten years ago
sw4641B-ms98-a-0010 55.975125 66.286250 i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which are based here and uh they'd have that job for life
sw4641B-ms98-a-0011 66.286250 71.729875 and you really didn't have to worry too much about that but ever since this Reagan Bush thing
sw4641B-ms98-a-0012 71.729875 81.739625 every single time there's you know th[e]- the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever there's a problem with the uh uh ec[onomy]- economy
sw4641B-ms98-a-0013 81.739625 87.003000 and clear out the employees and we're losing more and more jobs and uh
sw4641B-ms98-a-0014 87.003000 89.151500 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0015 89.151500 103.413000 yeah it's it's a real that's probably the biggest thing that i think people are looking for i uh put some things up in the Comp Dcom Telecom thing regularly about uh job security with the uh AT&T employees and
sw4641B-ms98-a-0016 103.413000 113.482500 the Communication Workers of America and i'm watching as that progresses more and more and it seems to me that we're seeing a real problem with job security
sw4641B-ms98-a-0017 113.482500 122.987875 being the number one focus it's no longer a question of salary or or perks it it's just basic security to have that job
sw4641B-ms98-a-0018 122.987875 129.251750 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0019 129.251750 131.105875 well i in
sw4641B-ms98-a-0020 131.105875 133.715750 [noise]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0021 133.715750 139.701750 well i think maybe some incentives on the part of the government to retain employees
sw4641B-ms98-a-0022 139.701750 148.994750 uh versus downsizing really why we're seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the uh increasing power of shareholders in the corporations of the country
sw4641B-ms98-a-0023 148.994750 159.203125 whenever there's a uh problem with uh the economy or the stock value you know the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs which means cut employees
sw4641B-ms98-a-0024 159.203125 166.418500 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0025 166.418500 172.773250 yeah California is really starting to feel the effects i think of the uh downturn
sw4641B-ms98-a-0026 172.773250 181.223625 you know you guys have been pretty insulated uh for some of the past ones i[t]- it hasn't hit as bad as it has out in the northeast here
sw4641B-ms98-a-0027 181.223625 188.456500 Rochester's luckily is a technology moving city i mean we have a lot of telecommunications and the like out here but
sw4641B-ms98-a-0028 188.456500 197.752875 Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills they're all gone they're all in Mexico now [laughter]

sw4641B-ms98-a-0030 205.980375 212.344000 well Cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees Cupertino [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0031 212.344000 221.104250 so you guys at least don't have those kinds of you know the only pro[blem]- software seems to be still a US strength versus hardware
sw4641B-ms98-a-0032 221.104250 230.076625 but you know the again in the future we're going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where we're going to have job security i think being the biggest focus
sw4641B-ms98-a-0033 230.076625 245.310000 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0034 245.310000 250.303625 well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company

sw4641B-ms98-a-0037 254.431875 265.099000 yeah well the hardware you know HDTV if we can keep control of that that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created
sw4641B-ms98-a-0038 265.099000 274.236625 [silence]
sw4641B-ms98-a-0039 274.236625 275.714000 um-hum
sw4641B-ms98-a-0040 275.714000 284.517000 well we i'm a home satellite dish owner and we have these arguments all the time about [laughter-standards] because of the video cipher of the scrambling system
sw4641B-ms98-a-0041 284.517000 294.728625 in place and there's two separate arguments over whether we w[ant]- should have an industry standard which many people can build equipment towards or whether we want to have a uh system where
