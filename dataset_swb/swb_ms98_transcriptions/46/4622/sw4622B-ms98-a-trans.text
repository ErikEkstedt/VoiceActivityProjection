sw4622B-ms98-a-0019 60.217000 65.634125 now being from Philadelphia i don't expect your dress code to be quite that relaxed right
sw4622B-ms98-a-0020 65.634125 70.163500 [silence]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0021 70.163500 71.292875 oh okay

sw4622B-ms98-a-0027 105.401625 107.136875 yeah well i uh [noise]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0028 107.136875 108.789125 i just recently
sw4622B-ms98-a-0029 108.789125 112.300000 applied for a different job in the company here and
sw4622B-ms98-a-0030 112.300000 113.416750 so i
sw4622B-ms98-a-0031 113.416750 127.547000 decided well i'd wear a suit and it it was very interesting uh like i said most of the people at at this company don't wear suits uh most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual almost the same clothes that that you'd wear to school
sw4622B-ms98-a-0032 127.547000 129.230250 [silence]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0033 129.230250 135.196875 [laughter] well it has been although the new president and CEO of the company is
sw4622B-ms98-a-0034 135.196875 138.891250 from a much more formal eastern uh background
sw4622B-ms98-a-0035 138.891250 152.018500 and so the result is that uh so anyway i wore this suit and i went over to uh uh to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it and it and
sw4622B-ms98-a-0036 152.018500 162.863750 i- i was almost converted because uh [noise] the effect of that suit on the way people res[ponded]- reacted and responded to me as opposed to
sw4622B-ms98-a-0037 162.863750 164.075375 [silence]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0038 164.075375 167.369250 the uh just to kind of
sw4622B-ms98-a-0039 167.369250 174.594250 how shall i say it they know you're there but they don't uh you don't there's no notice at all but when i wore a suit that day uh [noise]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0040 174.594250 177.367125 it was obvious that people didn't know
sw4622B-ms98-a-0041 177.367125 180.880000 whether i was a worker bee or a manager
sw4622B-ms98-a-0042 180.880000 183.894750 so people uh how shall i say it made a
sw4622B-ms98-a-0043 183.894750 189.240125 made much more effort to notice you acknowledge your presence say hello
sw4622B-ms98-a-0044 189.240125 191.719500 and uh things like that so
sw4622B-ms98-a-0045 191.719500 194.051750 [silence]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0046 194.051750 195.426875 yeah
sw4622B-ms98-a-0047 195.426875 205.427750 and so this dress for success thing i think is uh by and large i've i'm kind of uh convinced that uh by that just that one uh
sw4622B-ms98-a-0048 205.427750 210.412125 uh experience and then having talked to several other people that that uh
sw4622B-ms98-a-0049 210.412125 212.520000 [silence]
sw4622B-ms98-a-0050 212.520000 219.821750 unless you're in a an environment where they're going to make fun of of of better clothes that better clothes always pay off
sw4622B-ms98-a-0051 219.821750 222.605375 [noise] doesn't mean they have to be
sw4622B-ms98-a-0052 222.605375 225.017000 uh how shall i say it

sw4622B-ms98-a-0058 235.885625 240.633375 a little dressing a little bit above the standard i think would uh
sw4622B-ms98-a-0059 240.633375 244.880000 pay off so i'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again
sw4622B-ms98-a-0060 244.880000 246.648625 [silence]
