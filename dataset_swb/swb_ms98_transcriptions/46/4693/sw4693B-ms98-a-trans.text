sw4693B-ms98-a-0004 9.224500 11.968750 my mother was one of nine children in the family

sw4693B-ms98-a-0006 20.273125 22.692000 that show up at this family reunion
sw4693B-ms98-a-0007 22.692000 29.585875 i had come from a lar[ge]- like i say a large family i had forty four first cousins on my mother's side and we all know each other pretty well and
sw4693B-ms98-a-0008 29.585875 37.399125 and uh so it's a wonderful occasion when we get together and we don't see everybody each year but you know alternate years we get to see most everybody
sw4693B-ms98-a-0009 37.399125 40.050750 [silence]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0010 40.050750 41.505250 [noise]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0011 41.505250 44.259875 [silence]

sw4693B-ms98-a-0013 45.539500 47.596750 [silence]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0014 47.596750 49.155500 [laughter]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0015 49.155500 56.744625 well you have to go with the right spirit of course uh i think what makes our family reunions so good is that we there is so much love that is shared there
sw4693B-ms98-a-0016 56.744625 58.046875 uh
sw4693B-ms98-a-0017 58.046875 62.505125 [silence]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0018 62.505125 65.892750 well yeah many of us do actually uh
sw4693B-ms98-a-0019 65.892750 72.319500 i'm in my fifties now and my mother came from a generation where the only option was writing
sw4693B-ms98-a-0020 72.319500 74.747375 postcards letters whatever
sw4693B-ms98-a-0021 74.747375 78.453375 uh and she used to correspond with her sisters quite religiously
sw4693B-ms98-a-0022 78.453375 87.529375 and they with her so and of course that older generation still always sends all of us Christmas cards and it's wonderful [laughter-you] [laughter-know]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0023 87.529375 97.479500 so uh but it it ours is the type of family if i had no place to be i could call anyone of my aunts or my cousins and they would say come and stay with me for a few weeks
sw4693B-ms98-a-0024 97.479500 99.321250 um-hum it's
sw4693B-ms98-a-0025 99.321250 110.587625 [silence]
sw4693B-ms98-a-0026 110.587625 112.595625 oh well
sw4693B-ms98-a-0027 112.595625 116.791000 uh these attitudes are projected down to the kids
sw4693B-ms98-a-0028 116.791000 126.311125 that this is the place where we really want to go and and we can have a good time it's not a boring thing uh i guess once in awhile about thirteen or so maybe it's a little boring for them
sw4693B-ms98-a-0029 126.311125 134.803375 if if they haven't been there enough years to have formed friendships but my kids went every year and therefore they knew you know a lot of the other kids
sw4693B-ms98-a-0030 134.803375 138.723500 so then you kind of look forward to seeing some of these second cousins once a year
sw4693B-ms98-a-0031 138.723500 145.373875 we do go to uh it's Clear Lake Iowa where we hold it and we make every effort in the world to get the shelter house
sw4693B-ms98-a-0032 145.373875 150.822875 so we have a facility where we can be inside but yet the kids can go and be in the lake if they want to
sw4693B-ms98-a-0033 150.822875 156.438000 [silence]

sw4693B-ms98-a-0037 172.012875 178.539625 oh yeah uh-huh well okay but Iowa is very agricultural and spring is not a good time to try to do anything
sw4693B-ms98-a-0038 178.539625 183.353750 because so many were involved with agriculture so so do you have a reunion
