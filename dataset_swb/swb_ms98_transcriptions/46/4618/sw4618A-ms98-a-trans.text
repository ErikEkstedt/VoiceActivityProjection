sw4618A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.991875 [noise] go ahead [laughter] 
sw4618A-ms98-a-0002 0.991875 4.364375 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0003 4.364375 13.446125 um no i haven't but in my job i'm a nurse and we are allowed to be i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this
sw4618A-ms98-a-0004 13.446125 19.131375 anytime uh i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out
sw4618A-ms98-a-0005 19.131375 20.967500 and been tested
sw4618A-ms98-a-0006 20.967500 23.912000 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0007 23.912000 27.053375 they can if they choose to right 
sw4618A-ms98-a-0008 27.053375 31.329375 have you well wh[at]- have you had any experience with it at all
sw4618A-ms98-a-0009 31.329375 39.820250 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0010 39.820250 41.138875 uh-huh
sw4618A-ms98-a-0011 41.138875 42.998500 and what do you think about that
sw4618A-ms98-a-0012 42.998500 52.202750 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0013 52.202750 56.048250 right right see i know of that too
sw4618A-ms98-a-0014 56.048250 65.045375 and i also know that things like antihistamines Sudafed things like that can really throw it off and you cannot get a job
sw4618A-ms98-a-0015 65.045375 68.817125 because of it and they may not tell you the reason why
sw4618A-ms98-a-0016 68.817125 77.780750 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0017 77.780750 79.073250 uh-huh
sw4618A-ms98-a-0018 79.073250 86.442750 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0019 86.442750 97.703000 see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job and
sw4618A-ms98-a-0020 97.703000 99.870875 they weren't told why
sw4618A-ms98-a-0021 99.870875 106.159250 but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing
sw4618A-ms98-a-0022 106.159250 110.654625 or they would tell you or this person never use any drugs
sw4618A-ms98-a-0023 110.654625 111.986250 but
sw4618A-ms98-a-0024 111.986250 114.475125 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0025 114.475125 120.027250 um you should because you should be given another chance or at least
sw4618A-ms98-a-0026 120.027250 125.579375 able to justify it or something i have real mixed feelings about it i don't know
sw4618A-ms98-a-0027 125.579375 129.342125 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0028 129.342125 138.625625 the accuracy i don't know i don't know but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them and i think that a person deserves
sw4618A-ms98-a-0029 138.625625 144.418500 a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time
sw4618A-ms98-a-0030 144.418500 151.384625 and if you could show that i- i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking Entex
sw4618A-ms98-a-0031 151.384625 159.877250 and my doctor gave me a prescription for it and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have
sw4618A-ms98-a-0032 159.877250 167.013250 proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know and it didn't come up that i needed to do it but
sw4618A-ms98-a-0033 167.013250 174.801125 if this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them
sw4618A-ms98-a-0034 174.801125 179.124125 you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didn't do anything
sw4618A-ms98-a-0035 179.124125 180.942750 so i don't know
sw4618A-ms98-a-0036 180.942750 182.467375 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0037 182.467375 190.253375 yeah i'm not sure either the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it
sw4618A-ms98-a-0038 190.253375 197.534750 then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check
sw4618A-ms98-a-0039 197.534750 201.129750 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0040 201.129750 202.557875 yeah
sw4618A-ms98-a-0041 202.557875 206.974000 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0042 206.974000 213.212250 well it sort of is and this is it this i'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it
sw4618A-ms98-a-0043 213.212250 219.493375 from two ways you know as a health professional i wouldn't want somebody take care of me that was using drugs
sw4618A-ms98-a-0044 219.493375 225.991875 you know so as a patient i feel well yeah we probably should be protected but on the other hand
sw4618A-ms98-a-0045 225.991875 227.607375 there's a lot of things
sw4618A-ms98-a-0046 227.607375 236.976500 i should be protected from it they don't test my patients for too [laughter-so] you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way
sw4618A-ms98-a-0047 236.976500 240.324125 you can't go around testing everybody for everything
sw4618A-ms98-a-0048 240.324125 247.662625 so i don't know and i- i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you
sw4618A-ms98-a-0049 247.662625 257.999125 i think that a company or a boss could use this you know they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess i can see where it could become a problem
sw4618A-ms98-a-0050 257.999125 264.559500 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0051 264.559500 265.895375 really
sw4618A-ms98-a-0052 265.895375 266.924500 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0053 266.924500 269.029625 oh wow
sw4618A-ms98-a-0054 269.029625 274.730250 but maybe you shouldn't be held responsible for something you did several years ago
sw4618A-ms98-a-0055 274.730250 283.700375 that's the other thing i mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that
sw4618A-ms98-a-0056 283.700375 288.630875 they get out of later on and i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever
sw4618A-ms98-a-0057 288.630875 289.957125 so
sw4618A-ms98-a-0058 289.957125 291.517250 yeah
sw4618A-ms98-a-0059 291.517250 293.385625 [silence]
sw4618A-ms98-a-0060 293.385625 296.280125 i think that's true yeah
sw4618A-ms98-a-0061 296.280125 298.530000 yeah so that probably wouldn't be too good either
