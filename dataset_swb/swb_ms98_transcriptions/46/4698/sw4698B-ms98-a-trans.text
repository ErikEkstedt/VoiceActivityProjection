sw4698B-ms98-a-0008 39.045750 49.872125 i've i'm currently in school so i've i've had an IBM clone i guess for a couple of years now which i've been trying continually upgrading i guess 
sw4698B-ms98-a-0009 49.872125 63.423875 and uh i've found i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it and i can't really i've found that most of homework assignments um at the level i'm at really require some sort of computer uh simulation or analysis so
sw4698B-ms98-a-0010 63.423875 75.159125 it it's pr[etty]- very essential for me schools have them um but lot of times it so difficult to get on them at school it's very easy it it's much more convenient to have one at home
sw4698B-ms98-a-0011 75.159125 77.633750 at Georgia Tech
sw4698B-ms98-a-0012 77.633750 79.421625 yeah so
sw4698B-ms98-a-0013 79.421625 81.399250 yes actually

sw4698B-ms98-a-0017 89.009750 103.247750 um sure i have some games of course which i play on there and uh um [noise] i have a program which allows me to access a a weather data bank so i can like check up on the weather around the country or whatever which is a hobby
sw4698B-ms98-a-0018 103.247750 109.497375 so i[t]- it provides other means other than just strict uh you know computations and so on
sw4698B-ms98-a-0019 109.497375 113.668750 so have you do you have a computer for yourself at home

sw4698B-ms98-a-0030 157.348125 169.120375 yeah it's i- i uh i have a modem in my computer so i can log into the sys[tem]- the uh network at Georgia Tech and access my account through there which is which can be useful but um
sw4698B-ms98-a-0031 169.120375 182.189375 yeah that's that and word processing is while i tend to i mean obviously i do most of my almost all of my report writing on on my computer uh whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments
sw4698B-ms98-a-0032 182.189375 188.371250 so it's it's really become i don't know really -[be]come a mainstay i guess i can't even
sw4698B-ms98-a-0033 188.371250 202.776500 remember actually i don't think i've ever used a typewriter in in my life to do a um do a report because my family when i was growing up we got a a basic computer a a TRS eighty when they first came out 
sw4698B-ms98-a-0034 202.776500 207.194500 and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high so

sw4698B-ms98-a-0043 226.720500 235.555875 last year and i did that all on a computer and it s[eems]- seems like i just can't imagine how people did it before it must have been just so much so much work
