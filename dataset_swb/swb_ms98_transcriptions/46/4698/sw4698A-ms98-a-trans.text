sw4698A-ms98-a-0002 1.785750 6.248625 actually you know i've been involved in electronics a long time uh
sw4698A-ms98-a-0003 6.248625 6.862250 [noise]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0004 6.862250 14.571625 in computers and i have have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home
sw4698A-ms98-a-0005 14.571625 15.944250 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0006 15.944250 29.978250 uh up until i guess maybe about a year and a half ago i got one for my son a a M[acintosh]- Macintosh uh LC it's a real easy to use color uh
sw4698A-ms98-a-0007 29.978250 32.876875 computer and
sw4698A-ms98-a-0008 32.876875 38.643375 i got a very nice printer that goes along with it and he uses it for his school work
sw4698A-ms98-a-0009 38.643375 63.195125 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0010 63.195125 64.441750 hm
sw4698A-ms98-a-0011 64.441750 74.183875 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0012 74.183875 76.464875 where you going to school
sw4698A-ms98-a-0013 76.464875 78.282625 i see
sw4698A-ms98-a-0014 78.282625 80.219500 in engineering
sw4698A-ms98-a-0015 80.219500 81.630750 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0016 81.630750 85.358000 so that explains wha[t]- all the uh computer assignments
sw4698A-ms98-a-0017 85.358000 89.933750 well do you use your PC for things other than explicit computer work
sw4698A-ms98-a-0018 89.933750 113.126000 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0019 113.126000 122.553875 no no i just have one for my son and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for h[ome]- home computing
sw4698A-ms98-a-0020 122.553875 126.459500 at wo[rk]- at work uh [laughter]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0021 126.459500 138.498250 i'm a technologist uh and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming
sw4698A-ms98-a-0022 138.498250 150.748500 uh but now i find myself using the computer even the computer at work is primarily a um word processing system and a communication system
sw4698A-ms98-a-0023 150.748500 152.417750 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0024 152.417750 158.237875 yes E-mail is probably pulls down a third of all my time

sw4698A-ms98-a-0030 206.423875 214.184750 hum well i'm a old-timer i did my Master's thesis on uh a typewriter
sw4698A-ms98-a-0031 214.184750 217.620000 uh i rented an IBM Selectric
sw4698A-ms98-a-0032 217.620000 220.004625 and it was a pretty big deal
sw4698A-ms98-a-0033 220.004625 236.037750 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0034 236.037750 238.980125 yeah it uh
sw4698A-ms98-a-0035 238.980125 243.489500 well you know it's just it was just a completely different world then
sw4698A-ms98-a-0036 243.489500 252.479750 [silence]
sw4698A-ms98-a-0037 252.479750 262.168750 i like it yeah i like it from a distance really i- i see the packages on it uh that are available and it's nice i really don't use it myself
sw4698A-ms98-a-0038 262.168750 263.662125 um
sw4698A-ms98-a-0039 263.662125 270.409000 i when i come home from work i i like to stay far away from computers and electronic things
sw4698A-ms98-a-0040 270.409000 273.777000 uh so i let my son do it and
sw4698A-ms98-a-0041 273.777000 280.043000 uh of course you know there's uh there's an intellectual evolution taking place where
sw4698A-ms98-a-0042 280.043000 291.822750 i[t's]- i[t's]- it's sort of a joke but it's really true the old-timers even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like VCR's and whatnot and the kids they just take to it like candy
