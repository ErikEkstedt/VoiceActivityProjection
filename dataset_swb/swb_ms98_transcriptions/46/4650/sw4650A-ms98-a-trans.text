sw4650A-ms98-a-0012 38.077000 43.045125 but if i'm feeling jumpy i kind of enjoy a magazine because everything's short
sw4650A-ms98-a-0013 43.045125 52.022625 and you can you know lay perhaps look at the pictures read an article for a couple of pages you don't feel like you've committed yourself to all the time it takes to read five hundred pages

sw4650A-ms98-a-0022 93.064250 99.074375 uh well uh in the magazine world i guess i'm kind of
sw4650A-ms98-a-0023 99.074375 106.144125 i hate to stereotype myself because i'm not all that girlish in the sense of girlish you know i i can solder and all of that [laughter-kind] [laughter-of] [laughter-good] [laughter-stuff] 
sw4650A-ms98-a-0024 106.144125 115.356750 but in my magazines when i think about it um i have a cooking magazine i like because_1 i like to cook and there's some this thing called Country Home which has
sw4650A-ms98-a-0025 115.356750 119.756250 uh it's kind of a mellow thing with all kinds of American and
sw4650A-ms98-a-0026 119.756250 125.559375 uh you i don't know recipes and decorating and all kinds of girl stuff
sw4650A-ms98-a-0027 125.559375 129.444875 [laughter] i'm almost embarrassed to say that
sw4650A-ms98-a-0028 129.444875 131.492375 [silence]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0029 131.492375 136.142750 well the other day i was talking with a fellow about woodworking and and that's another thing i love to do
sw4650A-ms98-a-0030 136.142750 142.042375 i'm an artist and i'm into all kinds of crafts and things so i can i can saw and solder and all kinds of
sw4650A-ms98-a-0031 142.042375 146.657500 you know things that would make me not sound like the typical you know cutesy
sw4650A-ms98-a-0032 146.657500 149.031250 housewife type [laughter]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0033 149.031250 154.353125 but i guess in magazines i gue[ss]- i you know i run the line i suppose that's true
sw4650A-ms98-a-0034 154.353125 161.341250 uh at we have some Road and Track magazines around the house my oldest son likes and i'll pick that up too
sw4650A-ms98-a-0035 161.341250 166.101500 i enjoy it i like to look at the stuff i'd love to have if i had all the money to [laughter-buy] [laughter-it]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0036 166.101500 185.232750 [silence]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0037 185.232750 189.213125 it's kind of like sneaking a peek at the other side i [laughter-know] -[wh]at you mean
sw4650A-ms98-a-0038 189.213125 194.891250 i'm a big fan of the library i you know i i i don't really reread books so 
sw4650A-ms98-a-0039 194.891250 207.141375 with the price of the paperbacks and even the hardcovers going up i just why not use the library they'll even get anything you ask them to find for you so you know why not do that but i am a big fan of the new book rack you walk in
sw4650A-ms98-a-0040 207.141375 217.674750 and they've got all the new books and to me it's like a little treasure opening this crispy you know covered brand new book and i'll come home with the strangest things that i'd never would have picked out
sw4650A-ms98-a-0041 217.674750 229.003750 because you know they run through the whole Dewey [laughter-decimal] system and you know there was one on Alpine skiing that looked interesting and one on you know wood carving that looked interesting and you know you just find these things that
sw4650A-ms98-a-0042 229.003750 230.183500 um
sw4650A-ms98-a-0043 230.183500 231.464625 [silence]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0044 231.464625 235.609750 -[we]ll it's refreshing to pick up something that you would never go to a rack for i think
sw4650A-ms98-a-0045 235.609750 236.623000 [silence]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0046 236.623000 237.919875 but [vocalized-noise]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0047 237.919875 246.439500 i don't know that i have that much more to say about wood car[ving]- about wood carving i'm not even speaking thinking straight here about magazines um
sw4650A-ms98-a-0048 246.439500 248.224375 any other thoughts on your part
sw4650A-ms98-a-0049 248.224375 253.635250 [silence]
sw4650A-ms98-a-0050 253.635250 254.982375 yeah

sw4650A-ms98-a-0053 257.332500 267.634750 there are some um i'm particularly interested in the crafts and there is one called American Craft that lists all the shows and that kind of thing and um
sw4650A-ms98-a-0054 267.634750 271.015000 craft shows are a lot of fun to go to when it's not some
sw4650A-ms98-a-0055 271.015000 280.508375 some housewife in quotes who put lace on a pair of socks and sells that as a craft i mean that makes me crazy [laughter] you know but if it's really truly beautiful pottery and
sw4650A-ms98-a-0056 280.508375 284.113875 and you know hand hewn wood [laughter] stuff like that
sw4650A-ms98-a-0057 284.113875 294.768875 then i really enjoy it an[d]- and i'm going to start taking up some pottery which i've never done myself i've gone from woodworking to silver jewelry making to stain glass
sw4650A-ms98-a-0058 294.768875 299.138000 and pottery turning clay on a wheel is something i've never done and i just discovered [vocalized-noise]
