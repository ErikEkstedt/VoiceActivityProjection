sw4688B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.470125 [noise]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0002 0.470125 30.834875 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0003 30.834875 34.832375 um-hum that sounds about right [laughter]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0004 34.832375 57.358125 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0005 57.358125 58.927250 um-hum
sw4688B-ms98-a-0006 58.927250 63.492500 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0007 63.492500 64.958000 right
sw4688B-ms98-a-0008 64.958000 74.530000 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0009 74.530000 76.024000 uh [laughter]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0010 76.024000 80.675500 well it's kind of difficult for me because right now um like most teachers i'm laid off
sw4688B-ms98-a-0011 80.675500 84.113875 and [laughter] so um
sw4688B-ms98-a-0012 84.113875 87.080125 i spend most you know i substitute a lot
sw4688B-ms98-a-0013 87.080125 98.712250 so it's a lot it's very hard on a {nonfixed} income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not to try to keep track of finances
sw4688B-ms98-a-0014 98.712250 108.520875 and but i know uh how much i have to bring in a month [laughter] and that's about it that's about as far as we go and then anything extra is
sw4688B-ms98-a-0015 108.520875 111.911750 you know more or less split up between all of us
sw4688B-ms98-a-0016 111.911750 117.106625 and just thrown in the kitty more or less for a [laughter-rainy] [laughter-day]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0017 117.106625 121.383250 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0018 121.383250 125.406875 um no i'm a single mother i have three children
sw4688B-ms98-a-0019 125.406875 130.665500 so uh right now we're on we get fr[om]- you know aid from the state
sw4688B-ms98-a-0020 130.665500 137.620000 at this point because there's no other way to do it and my ex-husband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support [laughter]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0021 137.620000 144.180000 so right now i know what i'm getting from the state and um i have to balance more or less
sw4688B-ms98-a-0022 144.180000 150.953875 what i get from the state with my bills and um you know try to work as many days as possible
sw4688B-ms98-a-0023 150.953875 157.713625 any time they call me in but i still have to figure out if i work too many days then i lose all my state aid
sw4688B-ms98-a-0024 157.713625 164.318500 and [laughter-if] [laughter-i] don't work enough days then i don't get enough to meet the bills and it's like a juggling act every single month
sw4688B-ms98-a-0025 164.318500 172.570375 like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation
sw4688B-ms98-a-0026 172.570375 180.277875 so you know the four days before they only have a four day week and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in
sw4688B-ms98-a-0027 180.277875 181.064750 [laughter]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0028 181.064750 184.060875 they don't like to be absent before a vacation
sw4688B-ms98-a-0029 184.060875 192.607000 but we're shopping around as far as well i'm shopping around as far as trying to get uh that's why i'm doing this to get some extra money
sw4688B-ms98-a-0030 192.607000 203.627750 and um getting pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts my kids are in Boy Scouts so trying to get pledge sheets for the Boy Scouts because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me
sw4688B-ms98-a-0031 203.627750 210.899500 so [laughter] it sort of helps defray the costs a little bit but you know we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul
sw4688B-ms98-a-0032 210.899500 215.547875 i guess we're in the situation that a lot of Am[ericans]- you know middle class Americans are in
sw4688B-ms98-a-0033 215.547875 221.460375 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0034 221.460375 223.249875 oh my Lord
sw4688B-ms98-a-0035 223.249875 235.796750 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0036 235.796750 237.533000 really
sw4688B-ms98-a-0037 237.533000 245.989000 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0038 245.989000 247.343000 um-hum
sw4688B-ms98-a-0039 247.343000 250.441500 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0040 250.441500 251.563750 ah
sw4688B-ms98-a-0041 251.563750 253.254375 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0042 253.254375 254.440250 sure
sw4688B-ms98-a-0043 254.440250 275.233750 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0044 275.233750 276.734250 right
sw4688B-ms98-a-0045 276.734250 278.378500 [silence]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0046 278.378500 280.860625 um-hum definitely
sw4688B-ms98-a-0047 280.860625 289.243625 uh yes we do and we try to you know i keep track of every penny and more or less enter it in you know every single day i'm at the computer
sw4688B-ms98-a-0048 289.243625 295.215500 and it's like okay what do we have left what do we have to pay what have we paid this month what hasn't come in yet you [laughter-know]
sw4688B-ms98-a-0049 295.215500 299.522000 [silence]
