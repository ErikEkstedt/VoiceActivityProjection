sw4649A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.581375 [noise] um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0002 0.581375 1.674000 i've had
sw4649A-ms98-a-0003 1.674000 3.997375 uh three boys through
sw4649A-ms98-a-0004 3.997375 9.012250 i guess uh some child care each one of them an[d]- now they're in school so it's all over but uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0005 9.012250 12.912750 i guess i would say it's not easy to find what what most parents would want
sw4649A-ms98-a-0006 12.912750 16.582125 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0007 16.582125 17.708000 is that right
sw4649A-ms98-a-0008 17.708000 18.606250 [laughter]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0009 18.606250 19.953625 i guess uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0010 19.953625 23.386625 the um the only rule i can think of is that uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0011 23.386625 26.315625 i like to fi[nd]- look for places with uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0012 26.315625 35.458625 good respectable nonprofit behind them_1 like a university or a hospital or something like that if they're associated with a college or a university they're usually pretty good bet
sw4649A-ms98-a-0013 35.458625 36.843500 um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0014 36.843500 42.617875 i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy car or refrigerator something you'd like to get it from some
sw4649A-ms98-a-0015 42.617875 46.849625 good cutthroat capitalist company but not with child [laughter-care]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0016 46.849625 47.876000 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0017 47.876000 48.731500 i
sw4649A-ms98-a-0018 48.731500 49.850500 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0019 49.850500 54.405875 yeah for profit places i would really look at them_1 awfully carefully but uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0020 54.405875 55.713375 when i was
sw4649A-ms98-a-0021 55.713375 64.385125 when my kids were young i was teaching at a university and uh the child care center associated with our university was quite good so i felt confident that they would do the right thing
sw4649A-ms98-a-0022 64.385125 70.305625 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0023 70.305625 79.544500 oh you mean uh learning type uh [noise] yeah i mean actual experiments they would have to get your permission but yeah i suppose um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0024 79.544500 89.877000 if you're if there's a psychology department or an education department around you might find that they're pushing one form of education or another i guess that's true but uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0025 89.877000 93.906375 i never had a bad experience in that respect [noise] of course you
sw4649A-ms98-a-0026 93.906375 101.179125 also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents and they're you know pretty good people [noise]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0027 101.179125 106.517875 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0028 106.517875 107.795625 um-hum
sw4649A-ms98-a-0029 107.795625 108.954625 i
sw4649A-ms98-a-0030 108.954625 110.861750 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0031 110.861750 115.057750 yeah i never really worry very much about it i tend to think those are
sw4649A-ms98-a-0032 115.057750 121.759625 very rare but quickly exploited and made public so i never really worried too much about that being uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0033 121.759625 123.769750 uh the case with my boys
sw4649A-ms98-a-0034 123.769750 125.108500 um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0035 125.108500 127.472500 i you know i think those things get
sw4649A-ms98-a-0036 127.472500 134.460375 into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them_1 but i don't think it's as common as uh the newspapers would make you believe
sw4649A-ms98-a-0037 134.460375 135.481625 [noise]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0038 135.481625 137.446500 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0039 137.446500 140.363875 oh [laughter-yeah] i mean
sw4649A-ms98-a-0040 140.363875 141.320500 that
sw4649A-ms98-a-0041 141.320500 142.318000 [noise]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0042 142.318000 150.999375 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0043 150.999375 152.225750 right
sw4649A-ms98-a-0044 152.225750 164.356875 well in our case we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were um in school and i'm really happy we did it although it was very very difficult and i think it was the right thing to do when we were um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0045 164.356875 165.495500 we
sw4649A-ms98-a-0046 165.495500 173.308500 just decided that we would do it and we went ahead [noise] but um not everybody can make that choice and even even though my wife wasn't working we did have
sw4649A-ms98-a-0047 173.308500 180.250500 um one or another of the boys in uh child care for part ti[me]- just for uh part of the day 
sw4649A-ms98-a-0048 180.250500 186.885125 um or a couple of days a week just so that uh other things could get done around the house and so on so
sw4649A-ms98-a-0049 186.885125 189.231875 so we did look around i think my wife
sw4649A-ms98-a-0050 189.231875 198.906875 is much better than i am at just walking into a place and getting a feeling for [noise] whether it's a loving and caring place or not and uh so i would always trust her judgment on that
sw4649A-ms98-a-0051 198.906875 204.998000 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0052 204.998000 206.222500 uh-huh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0053 206.222500 217.206000 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0054 217.206000 224.276875 there's absolutely no question that you're gonna be the best [laughter] child care [laughter-provider] for that kid so [noise] yeah do it as long as you can [noise]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0055 224.276875 230.066125 but i think you know y[ou]- you have to look through a place and you have to get a feel for um
sw4649A-ms98-a-0056 230.066125 240.421750 how they treat the kids and uh uh what kind of staff members they have and how much turnover they have and things like that before you uh commit your child to them_1 and i think
sw4649A-ms98-a-0057 240.421750 251.594750 you have the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open that you're welcome anytime without notice in the middle of the day and so forth and if they're at all queasy about that then
sw4649A-ms98-a-0058 251.594750 254.639375 i'd look elsewhere yeah right
sw4649A-ms98-a-0059 254.639375 256.163000 [noise]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0060 256.163000 262.135250 you have other friends that have kids uh being taken care of in uh child care
sw4649A-ms98-a-0061 262.135250 265.545375 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0062 265.545375 266.957500 um-hum
sw4649A-ms98-a-0063 266.957500 275.275250 so but i really think the news reports are uh tend to sensationalize the problems i think the problems are more ones of
sw4649A-ms98-a-0064 275.275250 285.104750 cost and resources and um pay and exhaustion and [laughter] human things like that rather than these um uh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0065 285.104750 289.433375 really wi[ld]- wild abuse cases that you read about because it make good copy
sw4649A-ms98-a-0066 289.433375 290.459125 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0067 290.459125 291.491875 yeah
sw4649A-ms98-a-0068 291.491875 292.718375 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0069 292.718375 294.295750 [laughter-yeah]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0070 294.295750 295.636000 right
sw4649A-ms98-a-0071 295.636000 296.931250 uh-huh
sw4649A-ms98-a-0072 296.931250 297.933750 [silence]
sw4649A-ms98-a-0073 297.933750 298.946000 well
