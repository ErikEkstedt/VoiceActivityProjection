sw4637B-ms98-a-0004 6.369125 9.630375 yes i think it's important that we uh
sw4637B-ms98-a-0005 9.630375 15.370625 either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas
sw4637B-ms98-a-0006 15.370625 19.776875 it's going to be such an amazing
sw4637B-ms98-a-0007 19.776875 26.567250 in[surmountable]- insurmountable you can't even imagine the cost it's going to cost to take care of these people
sw4637B-ms98-a-0008 26.567250 32.920000 an[d]- and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost
sw4637B-ms98-a-0009 32.920000 36.709750 [noise] they're going to save a well fortune just implementing that money toward that

sw4637B-ms98-a-0024 91.459625 93.019875 it is
sw4637B-ms98-a-0025 93.019875 96.635125 uh AIDS is a major topic right now it's trendy
sw4637B-ms98-a-0026 96.635125 99.374375 in the news it's in everybody's point of view

sw4637B-ms98-a-0049 190.791375 194.685250 and they don't they don't have many RNs and very few BSNs
sw4637B-ms98-a-0050 194.685250 196.789625 so
sw4637B-ms98-a-0051 196.789625 198.894125 the care is shoddy yes
sw4637B-ms98-a-0052 198.894125 204.771125 uh the compassion is low the hours are long and there's a lot of people
sw4637B-ms98-a-0053 204.771125 207.947375 so they tend to isolate them and leave them
