sw4675B-ms98-a-0006 22.808000 33.748500 and it tends to work out pretty well that way i can anticipate you know a little better i usually try to guesstimate and then when the bill actually comes in i go ahead and fill in the actual amount
sw4675B-ms98-a-0007 33.748500 39.589750 that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left [laughter-at] [laughter-the] [laughter-end] of the month or at the end of the paycheck anyway

sw4675B-ms98-a-0036 132.176500 139.298625 right i for for years got paid once a month and and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once
sw4675B-ms98-a-0037 139.298625 145.481625 there's always one or two stragglers that usually they were for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones
sw4675B-ms98-a-0038 145.481625 153.642375 but i would pay all of them at one sitting and i would know okay you can go spend this much on groceries now and you get this much a week and that is it
sw4675B-ms98-a-0039 153.642375 156.076250 and and that worked okay for me
