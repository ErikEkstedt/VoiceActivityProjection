sw4696A-ms98-a-0006 42.754750 43.758750 [laughter]
sw4696A-ms98-a-0007 43.758750 45.448625 this is kind of new to him
sw4696A-ms98-a-0008 45.448625 51.497375 i- i don't know are you familiar with things that he's done in the past that have gotten quite a bit of attention
sw4696A-ms98-a-0009 51.497375 58.728875 like uh rescuing the EDS employees that were being held in jail in Tehran
sw4696A-ms98-a-0010 58.728875 60.937000 [silence]
sw4696A-ms98-a-0011 60.937000 62.120250 [noise]
sw4696A-ms98-a-0012 62.120250 67.488625 yeah [laughter] i mean this wa[s]- this was a few years ago probably ten or so ten or twelve
sw4696A-ms98-a-0013 67.488625 81.999250 uh he hired uh some retired Army guys to go in after him and and supposedly even i think went in by him[self]- with went in to see them disguised you know as somebody else
sw4696A-ms98-a-0014 81.999250 91.560000 but uh he at least ended up over there in one of the neighboring companies proba[bly]- countries probably Afghanistan or something to meet them when they came out of uh
sw4696A-ms98-a-0015 91.560000 93.944250 out of Iran
sw4696A-ms98-a-0016 93.944250 105.699000 and i think he was uh maybe a little getting a little bit involved in politics or something during the Vietnam war he uh tried to send supplies over to the prisoners

sw4696A-ms98-a-0021 134.375000 143.260500 and uh i[t]- since then he's started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time um
sw4696A-ms98-a-0022 143.260500 146.970750 my impression is that he's a pretty honest person

sw4696A-ms98-a-0035 225.864375 232.111750 could be i- i also suspect that one aspect of his personality would be that he would be rea[lly]- really tenacious
