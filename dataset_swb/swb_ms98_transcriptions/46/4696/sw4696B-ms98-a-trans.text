sw4696B-ms98-a-0003 6.899875 14.277750 um probably not in anywhere near as much there have been a couple of articles uh which i've basically glanced at um
sw4696B-ms98-a-0004 14.277750 28.737125 but that's about it i just find it interesting that somebody with that much money uh would be interested in the presidency in the first place i guess it's it's as much you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things
sw4696B-ms98-a-0005 28.737125 36.983125 uh as much as anything else i don't know it seems to me that if i had that kind of money i would feel like i were more influential as a private citizen than as the president

sw4696B-ms98-a-0031 174.937875 183.805000 i honestly don't think so uh not unless he really puts a lot of effort into it and i don't think he wants to i think it's
sw4696B-ms98-a-0032 183.805000 191.980750 uh i think being a seriously con[sidered]- being seriously considered as a presidential candidate is something that um
sw4696B-ms98-a-0033 191.980750 199.895125 it it just takes a really huge investment in personal effort not just you know i mean i'm sure it takes a lot of money as well
sw4696B-ms98-a-0034 199.895125 211.612500 but um just in terms of the number of personal appearances that you've got to make and all the the the hoops that you've got to jump through in order to get the media sound bites and get people paying attention to you i mean
sw4696B-ms98-a-0035 211.612500 222.889500 an occasional newspaper article wi[ll]- will show up for for any variety of things but being considered seriously i think is you know may take more than he's willing to put into it

sw4696B-ms98-a-0041 249.038875 254.089125 yeah well i don't suppose he'd have to do a whole lot of fund raising or uh
sw4696B-ms98-a-0042 254.089125 259.874500 worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from so he'd have that advantage
