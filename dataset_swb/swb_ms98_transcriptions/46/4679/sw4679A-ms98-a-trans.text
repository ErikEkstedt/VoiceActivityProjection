sw4679A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.033875 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0002 0.033875 1.124500 why don't you go ahead and start
sw4679A-ms98-a-0003 1.124500 42.167000 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0004 42.167000 52.150125 so you think if if trials were held by judges or experts that they they would tend not to uh admit or not to convict people on circumstantial evidence
sw4679A-ms98-a-0005 52.150125 56.699500 [noise] you know i [noise] i attended a trial in uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0006 56.699500 59.266000 in Germany when i was a student and uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0007 59.266000 63.490000 that's the sort of system they have the trials are held by a panel of
sw4679A-ms98-a-0008 63.490000 74.226750 three uh three or four judges who are well they're like lawyers i guess they're experts in the law and uh there [noise] there really isn't a jury and uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0009 74.226750 78.426875 uh they do the questioning also the judges do the questioning and uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0010 78.426875 80.125500 they uh [noise]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0011 80.125500 84.535125 it's i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because they uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0012 84.535125 88.416750 uh the judge is also sort of a jury 
sw4679A-ms98-a-0013 88.416750 92.730625 uh but i'm not sure i like [laughter-that] i think i [laughter-prefer] the jury system myself
sw4679A-ms98-a-0014 92.730625 95.032875 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0015 95.032875 104.484000 [noise] uh well actually i think in most criminal cases it wouldn't make any difference whether it was a couple of judges or
sw4679A-ms98-a-0016 104.484000 111.404250 a jury [noise] what i what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual that's where you really need a jury of peers
sw4679A-ms98-a-0017 111.404250 116.099125 because uh anytime the the government um
sw4679A-ms98-a-0018 116.099125 126.206375 is the government against the individual you need some k[ind]- yeah they need the protection of ordinary citizens i think that's really the only thing i guess where i would like to see the s[ystem]- system change is uh
sw4679A-ms98-a-0019 126.206375 131.337000 um there ought to be uh um well
sw4679A-ms98-a-0020 131.337000 134.856125 i guess i don't think that uh um
sw4679A-ms98-a-0021 134.856125 142.553125 juries need to decide sentencing all the time i think maybe the a judge is a better judge of that or um
sw4679A-ms98-a-0022 142.553125 168.999000 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0023 168.999000 170.451875 yeah
sw4679A-ms98-a-0024 170.451875 171.461000 [noise]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0025 171.461000 183.743250 well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe
sw4679A-ms98-a-0026 183.743250 188.469375 but people who do[n't]- who don't have day in and day out life long experience with
sw4679A-ms98-a-0027 188.469375 197.737625 what prison's really like and what the options are to ask them to decide for one case on one person based on what they see i think that
sw4679A-ms98-a-0028 197.737625 201.094625 is maybe uh a little bit naive
sw4679A-ms98-a-0029 201.094625 208.335750 in Texas here people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people um
sw4679A-ms98-a-0030 208.335750 209.807750 it's kind of a
sw4679A-ms98-a-0031 209.807750 217.426000 um hanging jury atmosphere [noise] but in a lot of places i think people bend over the other way but
sw4679A-ms98-a-0032 217.426000 218.710750 i guess
sw4679A-ms98-a-0033 218.710750 230.303625 i guess i like the system that they have in some places where the defendant gets to choose whether he's goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it some ca[ses]- some cases in some jurisdictions they can do that
sw4679A-ms98-a-0034 230.303625 232.712750 i kind of like that system yeah
sw4679A-ms98-a-0035 232.712750 238.954750 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0036 238.954750 240.156250 yeah
sw4679A-ms98-a-0037 240.156250 246.467125 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0038 246.467125 247.793875 yeah
sw4679A-ms98-a-0039 247.793875 257.431500 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0040 257.431500 258.855250 right
sw4679A-ms98-a-0041 258.855250 261.671750 and lawyers blow sand in their eyes
sw4679A-ms98-a-0042 261.671750 267.894625 i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries
sw4679A-ms98-a-0043 267.894625 270.704625 insurance cases and things like that
sw4679A-ms98-a-0044 270.704625 272.637000 where [noise]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0045 272.637000 276.463125 and um there'd be more honest settlements instead of this um
sw4679A-ms98-a-0046 276.463125 283.752375 uh tugging of people's heart strings and um making them_1 cry and feel like they're doing somebody good by giving them_1
sw4679A-ms98-a-0047 283.752375 289.090750 or giving them_1 two million dollars to make up for the pain and suffering [noise]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0048 289.090750 290.530000 [silence]
sw4679A-ms98-a-0049 290.530000 291.617500 so
sw4679A-ms98-a-0050 291.617500 298.053875 in i think in in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government but in civil trials
sw4679A-ms98-a-0051 298.053875 298.850000 i'd like
