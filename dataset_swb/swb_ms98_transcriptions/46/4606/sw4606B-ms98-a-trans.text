sw4606B-ms98-a-0005 10.026625 15.816750 well this should be an easy one i so much so like we could we have lots to talk about [laughter]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0006 15.816750 20.567125 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0007 20.567125 22.427875 yeah that would be all right
sw4606B-ms98-a-0008 22.427875 24.911500 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0009 24.911500 26.440000 okay
sw4606B-ms98-a-0010 26.440000 29.768250 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0011 29.768250 33.364875 uh actually it would be easier to tell you what i don't get
sw4606B-ms98-a-0012 33.364875 34.655375 [laughter]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0013 34.655375 42.849000 because i uh i receive Time Newsweek and the US News and World Report every week i get you know all the news magazines
sw4606B-ms98-a-0014 42.849000 48.703875 and pretty much everything associated with my hobby which includes gardening magazines and uh
sw4606B-ms98-a-0015 48.703875 54.583375 uh uh radio and things like that so i i'm just loaded over here [laughter]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0016 54.583375 74.446750 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0017 74.446750 80.893125 yeah i i since i'm in radio up here i have to try and stay informed with uh
sw4606B-ms98-a-0018 80.893125 88.584875 what goes on around there i i like Newsweek better than i like Time i you know magazines for me i get behind but i like them because
sw4606B-ms98-a-0019 88.584875 94.583375 uh the especially with the news magazines you get much more analysis than the newspaper can give
sw4606B-ms98-a-0020 94.583375 101.555125 and uh i'm interested also in reading some of the stories that just aren't big enough to make into the local papers here
sw4606B-ms98-a-0021 101.555125 112.776125 and uh of course you know for gardening i i get Better Homes and Gardens up here mainly i get gardening information maybe some recipes and sometimes these things have coupons in them too
sw4606B-ms98-a-0022 112.776125 115.953875 and that more or less pays for your subscription
sw4606B-ms98-a-0023 115.953875 125.042375 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0024 125.042375 126.089500 sure
sw4606B-ms98-a-0025 126.089500 134.033125 sure oh yeah it that's the thing you know they they have to be careful about which ones you get because they can be really expensive if you're
sw4606B-ms98-a-0026 134.033125 142.379250 not careful not to mention finding the time to read them it's even hard for me i'd i have mail buckets full of magazines i haven't had a chance to look at yet
sw4606B-ms98-a-0027 142.379250 143.243875 [laughter]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0028 143.243875 150.094125 [silence]

sw4606B-ms98-a-0030 151.748750 155.501625 [laughter] yeah that i- i- i- like Time a little bit uh
sw4606B-ms98-a-0031 155.501625 158.954875 i it's probably my second favorite of the news magazines
sw4606B-ms98-a-0032 158.954875 160.171000 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0033 160.171000 163.901875 uh i like Newsweek better uh because they have
sw4606B-ms98-a-0034 163.901875 175.397500 uh a couple of things i like they have the cartoons and the quotes in there which i think are funny and some of the stories you know they have the analysis like all the rest of them do but they also get some more offbeat stories
sw4606B-ms98-a-0035 175.397500 184.100125 which uh i'm interested in finding out more about and it seems just to me to be a better read than Time Time is my second favorite
sw4606B-ms98-a-0036 184.100125 194.085375 uh Time excels at the uh coverage of in-depth issues you know if you want to really find out something in-depth and learn about it Time is a good magazine 
sw4606B-ms98-a-0037 194.085375 195.595750 and U S
sw4606B-ms98-a-0038 195.595750 209.343125 [silence]
sw4606B-ms98-a-0039 209.343125 222.431250 well i i kind of fall down in to the choice category just because really as a man i really you know i don't particularly believe that i have a particular say over what someone else some woman has
sw4606B-ms98-a-0040 222.431250 225.120375 you know she has her choice to do
sw4606B-ms98-a-0041 225.120375 234.916250 [silence]
