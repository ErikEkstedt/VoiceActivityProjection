sw4615B-ms98-a-0004 3.903875 8.689125 short term uh it works out pretty well because
sw4615B-ms98-a-0005 8.689125 16.916250 we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much uh
sw4615B-ms98-a-0006 16.916250 21.513000 extra to go around uh long term is
sw4615B-ms98-a-0007 21.513000 30.076375 something we're starting [noise] to think about because our older child will be ready for college in about uh
sw4615B-ms98-a-0008 30.076375 34.584125 gee she's eight now so i guess about ten years good heavens
sw4615B-ms98-a-0009 34.584125 45.506875 so we're we're starting to think about long term considerations college and retirement but with not a whole lot of discretionary money it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it

sw4615B-ms98-a-0033 205.466000 210.654625 yeah checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be i'm convinced
sw4615B-ms98-a-0034 210.654625 229.884750 [silence]
sw4615B-ms98-a-0035 229.884750 237.821250 yeah i guess there other than things like the stock market or mutual funds there's really not much of a return on anything these days
sw4615B-ms98-a-0036 237.821250 239.103750 [silence]
sw4615B-ms98-a-0037 239.103750 251.175375 yeah the interest is so low i mean it it's nice for people buying homes but for older people who have money in CDs or whatever it must be awfully hard to see rates go down to three and a half percent or whatever
