sw4615A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.116375 [noise]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0002 0.116375 2.000000 um why don't you go ahead first
sw4615A-ms98-a-0003 2.000000 15.855375 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0004 15.855375 17.265250 sure
sw4615A-ms98-a-0005 17.265250 32.607875 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0006 32.607875 34.132250 um-hum
sw4615A-ms98-a-0007 34.132250 44.802750 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0008 44.802750 46.215750 sure
sw4615A-ms98-a-0009 46.215750 49.808000 that's kind of uh similar to what we're doing is um
sw4615A-ms98-a-0010 49.808000 62.152250 budgeting you know month to month is uh kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra so that's kind of how we do it uh from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever
sw4615A-ms98-a-0011 62.152250 72.136750 um long term that's a little bit easier for us because uh with uh our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings 401K plans
sw4615A-ms98-a-0012 72.136750 80.475125 um that kind of [vocalized-noise] you know retirement plans that kind of stuff so we can kind of put aside some money that actually
sw4615A-ms98-a-0013 80.475125 91.645875 is better for us not to see versus when it's on the paycheck and you have to try and take out some of that money you always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0014 91.645875 104.919250 uh long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because um it's automatically taken out so uh that works out much better for us so that's kind of how we do it anyway but
sw4615A-ms98-a-0015 104.919250 106.731125 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0016 106.731125 118.271125 [laughter-e[xactly]-] [laughter-exactly] and if you can't touch it you can't spend it either so that kind of works out where you get into uh some plans that you know you touch it you're going to get a penalty that kind of thing so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0017 118.271125 127.143500 it leads you to kind of say well i'm not going to take it out i'm going to keep it and uh keep it in there and let it grow so that some way
sw4615A-ms98-a-0018 127.143500 133.775375 maybe for retirement you're going to have that money [laughter] left let's hope anyway so you'll have that so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0019 133.775375 141.753500 that's kind of how we do it but ours is more like month to month too uh short term is to get things going so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0020 141.753500 154.583000 any way other than that uh is kind of how we do it so i don't know if we're our time is up or what [laughter] they'll let us know [laughter]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0021 154.583000 156.745375 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0022 156.745375 158.068375 uh-huh
sw4615A-ms98-a-0023 158.068375 162.165500 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0024 162.165500 176.792000 oh definitely definitely and uh it grows uh it it seems like at first you're not gonna see a big return but as the years go on if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better and uh
sw4615A-ms98-a-0025 176.792000 188.008125 so you know you just have to kind of look at it that way and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do automatic you know deposit from checks to where you don't see it
sw4615A-ms98-a-0026 188.008125 194.669500 and uh you know exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent
sw4615A-ms98-a-0027 194.669500 206.274875 it's put into our savings account and we don't see it then it works out to where you know you don't look at it you just look at the checking account and say this is what we have for money and that's it so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0028 206.274875 209.780375 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0029 209.780375 215.976625 yeah it it's easy because_1 you do spend it that's for sure like i said you know you kind of look at it uh
sw4615A-ms98-a-0030 215.976625 225.880000 y[ou]- you better have some other way of uh savings otherwise uh checking accounts aren't the best for you know long term type of planning so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0031 225.880000 229.510375 and you don't get a good return on it anyway so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0032 229.510375 231.532375 other
sw4615A-ms98-a-0033 231.532375 236.227625 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0034 236.227625 240.715875 exactly right now yeah it's a bad time you know
sw4615A-ms98-a-0035 240.715875 243.392375 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0036 243.392375 245.224250 um-hum
sw4615A-ms98-a-0037 245.224250 246.729875 um-hum
sw4615A-ms98-a-0038 246.729875 249.542500 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0039 249.542500 262.529125 exactly exactly you know we have some in-laws uh that uh had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and uh kind of took them_1 out of that because they got so low but uh
sw4615A-ms98-a-0040 262.529125 275.522000 yeah it's it drops so your better bet is to uh try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of uh savings plan or something like that to where they kind of match
sw4615A-ms98-a-0041 275.522000 281.621625 the percentage or whatever so or some kind of profit sharing so
sw4615A-ms98-a-0042 281.621625 288.566375 [silence] 
sw4615A-ms98-a-0043 288.566375 290.025500 sure
sw4615A-ms98-a-0044 290.025500 292.022500 oh that's great yeah 
sw4615A-ms98-a-0045 292.022500 292.989875 [silence]
sw4615A-ms98-a-0046 292.989875 294.414500 okay
