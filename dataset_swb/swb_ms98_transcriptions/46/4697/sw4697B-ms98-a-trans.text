sw4697B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.019625 [noise]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0002 1.019625 27.200125 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0003 27.200125 37.631625 right i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed
sw4697B-ms98-a-0004 37.631625 42.896500 uh i- i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case
sw4697B-ms98-a-0005 42.896500 56.975250 so a a judge you're right should have the whole dossier of the [laughter-criminal] there and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri[son]- position to give an appropriate uh sentencing
sw4697B-ms98-a-0006 56.975250 74.166000 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0007 74.166000 75.475875 um-hum
sw4697B-ms98-a-0008 75.475875 88.522750 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0009 88.522750 95.280875 in other words not not there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial
sw4697B-ms98-a-0010 95.280875 96.346000 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0011 96.346000 109.290250 i- i- i don't uh th[ere's]- there's a point on which we don't agree i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a 
sw4697B-ms98-a-0012 109.290250 117.206375 one of the parties wants one and i usually it's the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case
sw4697B-ms98-a-0013 117.206375 128.010750 so i['m]- i'm not out for [laughter] streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know that would require a change in the Bill of Rights i believe and so
sw4697B-ms98-a-0014 128.010750 129.053125 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0015 129.053125 131.183875 oh oh okay
sw4697B-ms98-a-0016 131.183875 148.250000 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0017 148.250000 153.925750 right well i think that's all ready possible i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh
sw4697B-ms98-a-0018 153.925750 166.283625 yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to
sw4697B-ms98-a-0019 166.283625 172.396875 to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into [laughter] per[haps]-
sw4697B-ms98-a-0020 172.396875 177.913000 giving a different sentence or possibly if it's a civil case giving higher uh
sw4697B-ms98-a-0021 177.913000 184.774125 you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award
sw4697B-ms98-a-0022 184.774125 191.390375 yeah and i suspect it in cases like i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right
sw4697B-ms98-a-0023 191.390375 196.561875 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0024 196.561875 204.502250 yeah well uh um in the case of c[ivil]- civil uh things i think maybe the
sw4697B-ms98-a-0025 204.502250 210.126625 the use of the jury is very often to the lawyer's advantage and i think that may be where jury
sw4697B-ms98-a-0026 210.126625 218.466625 use is overdone you know i mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently but the lawyers are really
sw4697B-ms98-a-0027 218.466625 230.629000 uh it's to their advantage to play to as big an [laughter-audience] [laughter-as] [laughter-possible] so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases
sw4697B-ms98-a-0028 230.629000 235.848500 not just sentencing in in a criminal cases uh
sw4697B-ms98-a-0029 235.848500 245.798500 i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that but i am in favor of it for criminal cases so there's a difference of my view there for those two
sw4697B-ms98-a-0030 245.798500 250.112250 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0031 250.112250 252.671875 have you ever had to serve jury duty
sw4697B-ms98-a-0032 252.671875 254.163500 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0033 254.163500 255.406500 uh-huh
sw4697B-ms98-a-0034 255.406500 262.534250 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0035 262.534250 263.805000 uh-huh
sw4697B-ms98-a-0036 263.805000 265.987250 [silence]
sw4697B-ms98-a-0037 265.987250 278.598000 uh-huh i[t]- it isn't sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh that would have been about uh twenty years too um uh just last year and
sw4697B-ms98-a-0038 278.598000 287.314125 uh the case i heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really trivial it involved two bicycles we didn't do the sentencing the judge did
sw4697B-ms98-a-0039 287.314125 288.751750 so
sw4697B-ms98-a-0040 288.751750 293.877125 we'd we uh rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
sw4697B-ms98-a-0041 293.877125 296.181875 and that was here in Wisconsin
sw4697B-ms98-a-0042 296.181875 299.938000 so i- i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it var[ies]-
