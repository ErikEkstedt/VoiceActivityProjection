sw4697A-ms98-a-0002 0.118375 10.474750 well th[e]- the question was talking about the juries and um one of the things i thought about was on a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders
sw4697A-ms98-a-0003 10.474750 17.407750 that um maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again
sw4697A-ms98-a-0004 17.407750 27.734250 um so that um a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day

sw4697A-ms98-a-0013 56.532500 58.687125 yeah see i agree with you um
sw4697A-ms98-a-0014 58.687125 72.512875 one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court i mean it's supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and you're done with it
sw4697A-ms98-a-0015 72.512875 84.411875 it's almost like the Night Court we see on TV um and um but it's not that we have uh such it didn't backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending
sw4697A-ms98-a-0016 84.411875 89.225875 um so i that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
