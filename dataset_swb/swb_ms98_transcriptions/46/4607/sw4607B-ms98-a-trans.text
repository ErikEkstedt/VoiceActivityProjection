sw4607B-ms98-a-0011 102.654625 115.553500 that seems to be the major thing and we just recently with all the problems that there are in Boston we did have i was thinking we did have one crime in Framingham where a girl picked up a guy at a bar
sw4607B-ms98-a-0012 115.553500 123.598500 and uh her kids woke up she brought him home and her kids woke up and she was dead she had been knifed to death

sw4607B-ms98-a-0014 130.978125 142.619750 really [laughter] i think that was th[e]- the major part of it too much alcohol and she just invited him in and he waited until she was sleeping and then let her have it
