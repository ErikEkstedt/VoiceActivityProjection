sw4612A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.494625 [noise]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0002 0.494625 4.394125 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0003 4.394125 10.063250 oh i suppose i uh substitute teach in our public schools
sw4612A-ms98-a-0004 10.063250 22.069000 and what i find out nowadays is people are wearing jeans and and very casual things Polo shirts [laughter-uh] i'm of the opinion that i'm not one of the kids and i want them to know that
sw4612A-ms98-a-0005 22.069000 27.693625 so i'll dress a little more formally i mean not a business suit but you know a nice skirt and blouse or
sw4612A-ms98-a-0006 27.693625 30.851250 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0007 30.851250 39.595500 well i- i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more Bohemian
sw4612A-ms98-a-0008 39.595500 52.465625 but [noise] yes yes teachers are wearing jeans and they're wearing sneakers [laughter-and] kind of upsets me because uh it seems that they're getting treated as if they're sloppy
sw4612A-ms98-a-0009 52.465625 54.455625 and i- i like the kids
sw4612A-ms98-a-0010 54.455625 55.535375 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0011 55.535375 59.086500 as if i[f]- if the whole situation is too casual
sw4612A-ms98-a-0012 59.086500 69.141750 i don't get think they get the same respect as if they distance themselves in their behavior from the kids and i think the way they dress says a lot about their attitude
sw4612A-ms98-a-0013 69.141750 73.922125 i think they're too casual with the kids and the ki[ds]- kids curse in front of them and
sw4612A-ms98-a-0014 73.922125 76.464000 a[nd]- and take too many liberties and i think
sw4612A-ms98-a-0015 76.464000 86.111750 uh you know as much as i'm there to be their uh to be there for them but i'm not their friend i'm there to teach them something and i[t's]- it's business and it's serious and
sw4612A-ms98-a-0016 86.111750 99.422500 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0017 99.422500 105.065250 [laughter] well i i think i'm talking about dressing how it conveys a uh
sw4612A-ms98-a-0018 105.065250 112.626750 a sense of um casual behavior and you know and and where it goes from there it's just a tangent of the same subject
sw4612A-ms98-a-0019 112.626750 124.048500 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0020 124.048500 125.480875 uh-huh
sw4612A-ms98-a-0021 125.480875 125.791250 [noise]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0022 125.791250 128.303125 what i[s]- is uh your particular field
sw4612A-ms98-a-0023 128.303125 130.106125 [silence]

sw4612A-ms98-a-0026 133.360375 137.577625 oh so you must be very interested in uh Texas Instruments [laughter]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0027 137.577625 139.735875 but anyway get off the subject
sw4612A-ms98-a-0028 139.735875 143.461500 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0029 143.461500 145.062750 [laughter-oh] [laughter-i] [laughter-see]

sw4612A-ms98-a-0034 175.102375 197.822125 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0035 197.822125 206.404250 uh-huh [laughter] it it well i guess it's silly in that the point is to be there and do quality work and not wonder about what you're wearing too [laughter-much] 
sw4612A-ms98-a-0036 206.404250 214.747375 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0037 214.747375 227.043500 wha[t]- uh no i can see how you'd say that i'm not heavily into uh what's in this year or what's out this year i u[sually]- i have a certain amount of money that i spend on clothing and i buy things that will last year after year and um

sw4612A-ms98-a-0045 250.896375 257.776125 i think it was just um clothing and how you feel about it and do you change your wardrobe from season to season
sw4612A-ms98-a-0046 257.776125 265.653875 um i guess the warmer it gets the less clothing i [laughter-wear] but i don't know that i i change my sense of color or style to
sw4612A-ms98-a-0047 265.653875 278.224750 to match a season but i do know people who have told me that the different carpets come out and different colors come out because uh the seasons change your mood and and your ideas of color and fashion change with uh
sw4612A-ms98-a-0048 278.224750 283.917000 uh you know with your mood and i guess it's all kinds of poetic uh
sw4612A-ms98-a-0049 283.917000 285.601500 [silence]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0050 285.601500 286.763375 [laughter]

sw4612A-ms98-a-0052 291.323250 293.110625 [laughter-oh] [laughter-okay]
sw4612A-ms98-a-0053 293.110625 299.522000 well some guys seem to think it's a shortcoming being too involved in their clothing like they have deeper more meaningful things
