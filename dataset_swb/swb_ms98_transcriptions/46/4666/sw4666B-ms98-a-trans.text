sw4666B-ms98-a-0029 104.548125 111.752125 well yeah [laughter] sorry about that yeah uh as far as the Twins are concerned it seems to be real good
sw4666B-ms98-a-0030 111.752125 120.523125 um my roommate went and saw them play um their season opener uh a couple of nights ago and they they won that one seven to one
sw4666B-ms98-a-0031 120.523125 122.257875 so um
sw4666B-ms98-a-0032 122.257875 126.678875 that's pretty good i guess it looks like they'll be doing pretty well
sw4666B-ms98-a-0033 126.678875 128.874875 are you still there
sw4666B-ms98-a-0034 128.874875 132.810250 okay i heard some noise on the line didn't know what happened

sw4666B-ms98-a-0039 155.806875 164.844125 uh-huh [laughter] well maybe that has has good tidings for their uh for their season coming up i've actually got a friend that's living in San Francisco right now
sw4666B-ms98-a-0040 164.844125 171.155500 uh he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is basically uh an internship we were both doctoral students
sw4666B-ms98-a-0041 171.155500 183.111250 and he's doing his with IBM and i'm doing mine with Honeywell but um i i think he kind of follows the sports and i think he's mentioned um the Oakland A's a couple times
sw4666B-ms98-a-0042 183.111250 187.515875 uh he may have watched them and seemed to think that they were pretty good
sw4666B-ms98-a-0043 187.515875 189.232625 [silence]
sw4666B-ms98-a-0044 189.232625 197.812125 as far as i know yeah and in the major leagues i guess there's a couple of different divisions and then of course there's the minors um
sw4666B-ms98-a-0045 197.812125 204.498625 i don't know i i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort i could really probably get into baseball
sw4666B-ms98-a-0046 204.498625 209.445500 um but i was talking to my roommate a couple nights ago right after that game
sw4666B-ms98-a-0047 209.445500 221.348125 and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because_1 apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from Honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually
sw4666B-ms98-a-0048 221.348125 226.349750 for the home games but th[e]- the thing is there's like eighty six home games per year
sw4666B-ms98-a-0049 226.349750 229.583625 so there's no no way you can ever use them_1 all
sw4666B-ms98-a-0050 229.583625 238.259875 eighty six i was amazed to hear that you know that's just the home games and i i thought it was a mistake but he goes no see eight
sw4666B-ms98-a-0051 238.259875 241.352375 yeah well j[ust]- just about yeah
sw4666B-ms98-a-0052 241.352375 243.175625 [silence]
sw4666B-ms98-a-0053 243.175625 244.488625 yeah
sw4666B-ms98-a-0054 244.488625 247.383250 and that's you know yeah that's almost
sw4666B-ms98-a-0055 247.383250 250.508750 [silence]
sw4666B-ms98-a-0056 250.508750 252.526000 that's a lot of baseball
sw4666B-ms98-a-0057 252.526000 254.349375 [silence]
sw4666B-ms98-a-0058 254.349375 261.660375 well you you if you if you consider it the season starts well it's the season started about a week and a half ago
sw4666B-ms98-a-0059 261.660375 268.734000 and it ends with the World Series which usually takes place i believe in December or January
sw4666B-ms98-a-0060 268.734000 274.451125 yeah i think so it did last wee[k]- year didn't it or was it November
sw4666B-ms98-a-0061 274.451125 280.163375 maybe it was November i'm thinking about i know it was doggone cold up here um
sw4666B-ms98-a-0062 280.163375 282.609125 [silence]
sw4666B-ms98-a-0063 282.609125 287.085250 well i know for sure it was i know it was after September
sw4666B-ms98-a-0064 287.085250 289.216125 because that's when i got up here
sw4666B-ms98-a-0065 289.216125 292.411625 and i[t]- and it was at least two months after i got up here
sw4666B-ms98-a-0066 292.411625 295.112875 yeah so it had to be November anyway
sw4666B-ms98-a-0067 295.112875 297.186000 [silence]
