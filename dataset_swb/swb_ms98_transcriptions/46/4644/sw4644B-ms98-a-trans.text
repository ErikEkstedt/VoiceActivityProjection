sw4644B-ms98-a-0007 86.034750 95.258625 at the end of tax season because they you know they're fairly even though they're a large scale company they're very the offices individual offices are very small

sw4644B-ms98-a-0010 113.422875 116.832000 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0011 116.832000 126.156500 right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together
sw4644B-ms98-a-0012 126.156500 127.688625 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0013 127.688625 129.810375 yeah [vocalized-noise]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0014 129.810375 131.694875 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0015 131.694875 133.091125 really
sw4644B-ms98-a-0016 133.091125 145.831250 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0017 145.831250 147.061000 oh
sw4644B-ms98-a-0018 147.061000 169.275000 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0019 169.275000 180.450750 right the only trouble we've had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problem especially the retired ones my father's retired from the town of Framingham
sw4644B-ms98-a-0020 180.450750 185.971500 and he said that they haven't gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years
sw4644B-ms98-a-0021 185.971500 193.736875 and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired an[d]- but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and it's
sw4644B-ms98-a-0022 193.736875 195.899375 hopefully will go through
sw4644B-ms98-a-0023 195.899375 208.183000 but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isn't just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know
sw4644B-ms98-a-0024 208.183000 214.983625 uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits and
sw4644B-ms98-a-0025 214.983625 223.540500 that's all the town workers water and sewer and where it's a very large town it's actually should be a city but they kept it a town
sw4644B-ms98-a-0026 223.540500 228.403375 um where it's extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more
sw4644B-ms98-a-0027 228.403375 234.315250 which was really great because_1 we don't have to pay a mayor [laughter]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0028 234.315250 239.593625 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0029 239.593625 246.137000 right because_1 most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part time
sw4644B-ms98-a-0030 246.137000 251.945625 so it [laughter-works] [laughter-out] [laughter-good] [laughter-because] we reap the benefits of it and um
sw4644B-ms98-a-0031 251.945625 256.901125 but as far as shopping for a job i'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary [laughter]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0032 256.901125 275.477875 [silence]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0033 275.477875 278.178500 right [laughter]
sw4644B-ms98-a-0034 278.178500 291.949000 [silence]
