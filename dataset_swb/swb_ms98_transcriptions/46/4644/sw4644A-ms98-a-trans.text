sw4644A-ms98-a-0002 0.274125 6.408875 well um preferred benefits um i worked for a large corporation in the past
sw4644A-ms98-a-0003 6.408875 12.425750 and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because
sw4644A-ms98-a-0004 12.425750 25.565375 right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and uh there's a lot of profit that's coming in but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to
sw4644A-ms98-a-0005 25.565375 30.825625 pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it
sw4644A-ms98-a-0006 30.825625 32.260125 and uh
sw4644A-ms98-a-0007 32.260125 41.274750 the benefits aren't as great as when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say
sw4644A-ms98-a-0008 41.274750 52.308000 okay we've got this amount of money let's put into this plan this plan you got Four O One K plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just
sw4644A-ms98-a-0009 52.308000 58.543375 in general maternity leave plans tha[t]- that kind of thing big corporations are able to do that versus
sw4644A-ms98-a-0010 58.543375 61.548250 small corporations uh
sw4644A-ms98-a-0011 61.548250 67.333625 you know they just don't have the money or just uh feel that there isn't a need for it
sw4644A-ms98-a-0012 67.333625 75.497000 so i've worked for both big and small so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both

sw4644A-ms98-a-0035 127.957500 137.667000 because like like the small corporation that i work for there's no pension plan there's no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for
sw4644A-ms98-a-0036 137.667000 146.106625 there's really i think you're allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a w[eek]- a year it's not accumulative type of sick leave
sw4644A-ms98-a-0037 146.106625 155.555000 um you know things like that so i've been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health
sw4644A-ms98-a-0038 155.555000 162.345125 health care uh you had your insurance and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place
sw4644A-ms98-a-0039 162.345125 169.395750 um they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations

sw4644A-ms98-a-0077 271.689750 282.686875 um i'm Honeywell uh uh Texas Instruments [laughter] i know people that are that have vacation times and bene[fits]- benefits that
sw4644A-ms98-a-0078 282.686875 292.394500 i wouldn't even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and it's like come on you know partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer
sw4644A-ms98-a-0079 292.394500 298.423000 and and of course when it's a small corporation it also wants to expand so that money's spent
