sw4667A-ms98-a-0005 7.711750 68.996125 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0006 68.996125 72.071375 yeah there there wouldn't have to be some way to pay for it
sw4667A-ms98-a-0007 72.071375 73.318500 the
sw4667A-ms98-a-0008 73.318500 74.569875 the
sw4667A-ms98-a-0009 74.569875 78.407250 i agree with you that that uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0010 78.407250 85.594000 it's no fun to to not have insurance i'm i've had health insurance through my uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0011 85.594000 94.017875 either my parents uh employment or my employment for many years but uh now i'm looking as at a
sw4667A-ms98-a-0012 94.017875 98.777750 layoff situation and i'm sitting here saying well how much is it going to cost me
sw4667A-ms98-a-0013 98.777750 106.640500 the uh the prospect of going without health insurance is is uh not very exciting to me either
sw4667A-ms98-a-0014 106.640500 107.967625 uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0015 107.967625 111.245250 the the problem that i have with
sw4667A-ms98-a-0016 111.245250 113.231750 with uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0017 113.231750 114.402875 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0018 114.402875 120.983500 universal health insurance is the problem of basically just absolute and complete distrust
sw4667A-ms98-a-0019 120.983500 122.878500 for the politicians
sw4667A-ms98-a-0020 122.878500 130.779625 they'll start i mean they could they could say we're going to do it the right way in the beginning and convince me
sw4667A-ms98-a-0021 130.779625 135.113375 but i don't have a lot of faith that they would
sw4667A-ms98-a-0022 135.113375 136.622125 uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0023 136.622125 138.653625 that they would not
sw4667A-ms98-a-0024 138.653625 141.514000 use it as a as a uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0025 141.514000 142.654625 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0026 142.654625 148.408750 oh as a carrot to get votes uh my i called and asked
sw4667A-ms98-a-0027 148.408750 151.674750 uh the uh unemployment insurance people here
sw4667A-ms98-a-0028 151.674750 157.918500 i said how long you know what's the unem[ployed]- what do i get if i'm unemployed and how long will i get it
sw4667A-ms98-a-0029 157.918500 162.509875 you know it's very interesting the guy on the other end is a young man he said uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0030 162.509875 170.709750 uh with a good sense of humor he says well he says right now it's twenty six weeks uh in periods of severe unemployment and just before an election
sw4667A-ms98-a-0031 170.709750 179.529000 they will extend it and get all the votes of the people that that like that but he says in your case uh if you're going uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0032 179.529000 186.678625 to be needing it in a little while by the time you get to the end of your twenty six weeks uh the elections will be over and
sw4667A-ms98-a-0033 186.678625 189.294250 we won't have it anymore i can tell you that
sw4667A-ms98-a-0034 189.294250 191.297375 [laughter] [laughter-so] [laughter-i]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0035 191.297375 202.195625 so i'm uh uh i['m]- i'm uh for the first time i'm i'm seeing things to a uh i'm paying attention to things that i never paid bef[ore]- uh att[ention]- a[ttention]- attention to
sw4667A-ms98-a-0036 202.195625 204.821375 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0037 204.821375 211.551875 on the other hand like i say they i have i have lived in places where they had uh free medical care
sw4667A-ms98-a-0038 211.551875 212.673125 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0039 212.673125 216.451875 and i have to say that that uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0040 216.451875 218.726625 [silence]
sw4667A-ms98-a-0041 218.726625 221.706125 that it that it was uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0042 221.706125 225.575375 it was comforting to know that you had it but but
sw4667A-ms98-a-0043 225.575375 228.487125 the way it worked in practice was
sw4667A-ms98-a-0044 228.487125 229.743000 that
sw4667A-ms98-a-0045 229.743000 232.054375 uh in order to get enough
sw4667A-ms98-a-0046 232.054375 233.578250 doctors
sw4667A-ms98-a-0047 233.578250 239.664125 the uh they used a lot of student doctors a lot more than people would put up with over here
sw4667A-ms98-a-0048 239.664125 241.501250 and
sw4667A-ms98-a-0049 241.501250 251.201250 uh my wife has dozens and dozens of stories of people that went in for a simple operation and then died on the table because of the incompetent care
sw4667A-ms98-a-0050 251.201250 259.366500 so i'm a[nd]- and she didn't have any axe to grind you know she just grew up in that situation and said well that's the way it is and uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0051 259.366500 262.754625 so on the one hand i i'm
sw4667A-ms98-a-0052 262.754625 264.777875 i'm saying well
sw4667A-ms98-a-0053 264.777875 269.368500 now i know how people that don't have insurance feel and on the other hand i'm saying uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0054 269.368500 276.887125 i don't trust the politicians very much i think that they are very good at at uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0055 276.887125 280.623500 i think they're so corrupt that they just use it as a vote getting
sw4667A-ms98-a-0056 280.623500 286.883500 uh situation and they don't pay an[d]- and they don't make it a very uh
sw4667A-ms98-a-0057 286.883500 290.484625 there's not a lot of integrity to the things that they do
sw4667A-ms98-a-0058 290.484625 298.562000 [silence]
