sw4680B-ms98-a-0003 6.826500 11.256375 well you're probably right up here in Rochester we uh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0004 11.256375 21.547250 we don't have uh much controversy about immigration you know being on the Canadian border there's not a whole lot of people [laughter] you know dying to come across and live here
sw4680B-ms98-a-0005 21.547250 23.196625 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0006 23.196625 27.980750 [laughter] sometimes i think they ought to [laughter]

sw4680B-ms98-a-0011 50.310750 53.367375 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0012 53.367375 55.673125 yeah i think it's uh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0013 55.673125 59.595500 i think it's a real shame but on the other hand you know it kind of
sw4680B-ms98-a-0014 59.595500 70.548500 even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that there's something better here than or at least they think there's something better here than there is uh wherever they're from
sw4680B-ms98-a-0015 70.548500 76.887500 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0016 76.887500 78.409250 yeah

sw4680B-ms98-a-0022 92.183750 100.921125 yeah that's true but i think that's probably always been true throughout uh history of the United States uh i think anytime you have uh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0023 100.921125 106.337375 you know immigrants coming in who perhaps you know don't have the ability to communicate with a
sw4680B-ms98-a-0024 106.337375 116.062000 large percentage of the population that's already here i think they're bound to to push the social services a little bit do you think it's worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago
sw4680B-ms98-a-0025 116.062000 126.645875 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0026 126.645875 128.728875 uh-huh yeah

sw4680B-ms98-a-0032 143.555750 145.232750 yeah you're probably r[ight]-
sw4680B-ms98-a-0033 145.232750 149.919625 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0034 149.919625 151.798000 uh-huh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0035 151.798000 153.732625 okay

sw4680B-ms98-a-0040 169.622375 171.342000 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0041 171.342000 173.692750 that's right that's right
sw4680B-ms98-a-0042 173.692750 180.232500 it's really interesting to me because as as you as as you pointed out at the beginning here in Rochester uh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0043 180.232500 193.988625 now we don't have it immigration pro[blem]- we don't even have a lot of immigration but on the other hand you know it's we do have uh a large influx of uh people from say Jamaica
sw4680B-ms98-a-0044 193.988625 203.537500 or other parts of the Caribbean tha[t]- that's rea[lly]- you know and Puerto Rico we have a a large population from there people who have come over you know maybe in the last you know ten or twenty years
sw4680B-ms98-a-0045 203.537500 216.082125 have moved here now why somebody from Jamaica want to would want to move to cold Rochester [laughter] i'm a little uh i'm a little hard pressed [laughter] to understand but they do it so so you know i don't blame them to each their own
sw4680B-ms98-a-0046 216.082125 221.392625 but you know if you look at at a place like Rochester now now we have a large
sw4680B-ms98-a-0047 221.392625 225.538250 population of like second and third generation Americans
sw4680B-ms98-a-0048 225.538250 237.283875 of people who ca[me]- you know whose parents or grandparents came to uh the United States you know people from Italy uh people from Poland people from the Ukraine um
sw4680B-ms98-a-0049 237.283875 243.045000 an[d]- and i always you know i always wonder whether you know was the situation any different
sw4680B-ms98-a-0050 243.045000 251.751500 back then i mean how did the people who had been in the United States for for a while feel about this large amount of immigration
sw4680B-ms98-a-0051 251.751500 263.250500 uh it's fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who i won't say their name but i'm sure you've heard of them uh back in the thirties didn't want to hire the Italian immigrants
sw4680B-ms98-a-0052 263.250500 266.580250 because it it was it was a discriminatory practice
sw4680B-ms98-a-0053 266.580250 268.251500 and uh
sw4680B-ms98-a-0054 268.251500 282.804375 you know it just makes me wonder you know and you know i look at what what made this country great and a lot of cases it was the immigrants who came over and worked and i and sometimes i wonder you know whether you know just how different is the situation today
sw4680B-ms98-a-0055 282.804375 288.595000 [silence]
sw4680B-ms98-a-0056 288.595000 289.960875 um-hum
