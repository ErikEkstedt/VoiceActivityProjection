sw4659B-ms98-a-0015 66.340625 72.226750 and so if they had business to do they had to finish it you know three days in advance so they could get it through the mail
sw4659B-ms98-a-0016 72.226750 77.571750 and now it's the kind of thing where you can work up until the last minute
sw4659B-ms98-a-0017 77.571750 81.578625 because you can get it there you know in in a matter of minutes
sw4659B-ms98-a-0018 81.578625 90.982750 you know through a fax machine and because of that these quote unquote convenience type items have actually made work that much more intense and that much harder
sw4659B-ms98-a-0019 90.982750 94.589375 because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute
sw4659B-ms98-a-0020 94.589375 112.229000 [silence]

sw4659B-ms98-a-0031 186.836375 194.194375 well there's that and there's the fact that you know nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids
sw4659B-ms98-a-0032 194.194375 205.950750 what generally tends to happen i mean the U S would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
sw4659B-ms98-a-0033 205.950750 214.843625 [silence]

sw4659B-ms98-a-0040 237.946750 250.020750 most of the of the next generation is going to be in or or an ex[tremely]- ex[tremely]- extremely large par[t]- part of the next generation is going to be you know second generation f[rom]- uh from immigrant parents
sw4659B-ms98-a-0041 250.020750 256.895250 and they're going to be really struggling and i don't think that America is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom
sw4659B-ms98-a-0042 256.895250 261.299750 is necessarily considered to be good [laughter]
sw4659B-ms98-a-0043 261.299750 268.690625 i mean it's no longer the the uh the accomplishment that it that it once was and not that many people are really trying i don't think
