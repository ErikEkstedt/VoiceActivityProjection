sw4659A-ms98-a-0006 31.495250 49.907500 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0007 49.907500 54.249375 right we fax everything we don't even wait for the mail anymore
sw4659A-ms98-a-0008 54.249375 55.478250 right
sw4659A-ms98-a-0009 55.478250 71.038625 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0010 71.038625 72.444000 right
sw4659A-ms98-a-0011 72.444000 77.243875 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0012 77.243875 78.405000 um-hum
sw4659A-ms98-a-0013 78.405000 80.995500 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0014 80.995500 82.393875 right
sw4659A-ms98-a-0015 82.393875 90.503250 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0016 90.503250 92.129125 right
sw4659A-ms98-a-0017 92.129125 105.577125 you're expected to exactly and i recently read an article on just this that said stress today is so much worse it should be less because we have a microwave and our grandmother's had to bake brownies and
sw4659A-ms98-a-0018 105.577125 115.234625 we can throw them_1 in a microwave for two minutes but the more conveniences we have the more that's expected of us and we have no downtime
sw4659A-ms98-a-0019 115.234625 119.941125 like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to
sw4659A-ms98-a-0020 119.941125 131.708875 so we keep moving we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing so we have no relaxation time in between
sw4659A-ms98-a-0021 131.708875 141.034250 so they say that's really a bad thing that you need to learn a lot of ways to to deal with that and get your your time in between things
sw4659A-ms98-a-0022 141.034250 145.030750 so that's good that's an interesting point
sw4659A-ms98-a-0023 145.030750 149.560000 but i just think our our family lives have changed drastically
sw4659A-ms98-a-0024 149.560000 161.252875 and i think that's jus[t]- of course a part of it is technology i mean our kids where would they be without Nintendo and you know their TV shows and that and some of that is really bad i think
sw4659A-ms98-a-0025 161.252875 168.253750 but we have all single families so many single families now um
sw4659A-ms98-a-0026 168.253750 181.939500 a lot of working both parents are working so -[th]ere's a whole big effect on our kids and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father
sw4659A-ms98-a-0027 181.939500 187.141750 you know i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years
sw4659A-ms98-a-0028 187.141750 205.795000 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0029 205.795000 214.738875 you're probably right and i'm an O B nurse and that's never really occurred to me but that's that's interesting i never really thought about it that way
sw4659A-ms98-a-0030 214.738875 218.444125 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0031 218.444125 222.559750 yeah yeah that's true when is this good or not good
sw4659A-ms98-a-0032 222.559750 224.899125 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0033 224.899125 226.637500 we don't know that yet
sw4659A-ms98-a-0034 226.637500 227.702625 [laughter]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0035 227.702625 234.477750 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0036 234.477750 237.086875 yeah i don't know either
sw4659A-ms98-a-0037 237.086875 249.696625 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0038 249.696625 251.026250 that's true
sw4659A-ms98-a-0039 251.026250 260.222375 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0040 260.222375 262.349000 right right
sw4659A-ms98-a-0041 262.349000 267.712125 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0042 267.712125 268.919500 yeah
sw4659A-ms98-a-0043 268.919500 271.469000 yeah that's kind of scary
sw4659A-ms98-a-0044 271.469000 272.475875 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0045 272.475875 273.587250 hum
sw4659A-ms98-a-0046 273.587250 274.959000 [silence]
sw4659A-ms98-a-0047 274.959000 281.421250 well that's true but i it's just very very different and i guess every ten years it's just been very different
sw4659A-ms98-a-0048 281.421250 286.117625 so and i don't know what's gonna happen um
sw4659A-ms98-a-0049 286.117625 294.020500 i know what i'm seeing here at my we[ll]- my job is that people are having their children much later in life
sw4659A-ms98-a-0050 294.020500 299.394000 so that they're establishing careers and they've got their homes and they've got a l[ot]-
