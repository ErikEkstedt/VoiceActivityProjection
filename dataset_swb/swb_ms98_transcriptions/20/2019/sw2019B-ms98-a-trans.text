sw2019B-ms98-a-0075 297.514500 306.281125 uh she's still trying to play but she doesn't completely understand what's going on and we've had a little confusion w[ith]- with uh with younger kids
sw2019B-ms98-a-0076 306.281125 315.358375 but uh you know that's it's a matter of exposure really um we uh took her home to uh my family's place in South Dakota

sw2019B-ms98-a-0081 350.727125 357.839625 it was it was just su[ch]- such a new experience for her she's only been around one and and sometimes two people at the most so uh
