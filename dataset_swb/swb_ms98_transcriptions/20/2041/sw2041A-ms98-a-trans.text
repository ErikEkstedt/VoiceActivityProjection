sw2041A-ms98-a-0014 45.266375 47.908250 i don't feel like i
sw2041A-ms98-a-0015 47.908250 60.132750 i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise i don't feel well unless i am exercising and i try to do things that involve exercise but i very rarely do things
sw2041A-ms98-a-0016 60.132750 65.949125 like um i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured this is my exercise time
sw2041A-ms98-a-0017 65.949125 71.349000 but i do lots of outdoor sports and things bicycling uh

sw2041A-ms98-a-0019 72.511000 73.582375 you know
sw2041A-ms98-a-0020 73.582375 79.732000 mountaineering a little mountaineering this and that and i spend a lot of time and i probably get more exercise than your average person
sw2041A-ms98-a-0021 79.732000 93.788875 but it's not a a structured sort of thing and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake and perhaps it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun or something like that

sw2041A-ms98-a-0059 214.371250 227.268250 [laughter] so it's the it's it's the the act[ive]- well it's actually it's interesting because there are rea[l]- real regional differences um in California there's uh almost an assumption
sw2041A-ms98-a-0060 227.268250 228.355375 um
sw2041A-ms98-a-0061 228.355375 230.917750 unless you're sort of clearly of an
sw2041A-ms98-a-0062 230.917750 235.644625 uh an older generation or something you know in your sixties or something like that i'm i'm i'm 
sw2041A-ms98-a-0063 235.644625 246.891750 i'm not uh there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness and and at least in urban California and maybe not i don't know about rural California too well but in urban California it's just 
sw2041A-ms98-a-0064 246.891750 252.894250 you know for all i know aerobics started out here i don't know where they actually started but they you know the craze really picked up big here
sw2041A-ms98-a-0065 252.894250 264.904125 and before that there was the running craze and they California gets you know tends to be a bit faddish but the remarkable thing is how well the fads catch on elsewhere so there must be something to some of them and uh [noise]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0066 264.904125 279.050000 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0067 279.050000 280.560000 um-hum

sw2041A-ms98-a-0070 285.536250 293.889500 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0071 293.889500 301.694375 well there's a sense of it being a package i think there there is a sense of you know whole there's a lot of uh you know you'll get 
sw2041A-ms98-a-0072 301.694375 309.941875 organizations like institutes for the whole health or whatever and uh oh the Uni[versity]- Uni[versity]- Uni[versity]- the University of California at Berkeley puts out The Wellness Letter
sw2041A-ms98-a-0073 309.941875 313.510125 which is uh turned into a fairly well subscribed to uh newsletter
sw2041A-ms98-a-0074 313.510125 316.946250 monthly or biweekly newsletter or something like that and
sw2041A-ms98-a-0075 316.946250 322.263125 and it doesn't deal with just exercise or just stress management or just diet or anything it it's
sw2041A-ms98-a-0076 322.263125 335.006375 on fairly s[olid]- solid scientific ground uh it's just dispensed with these distinctions it says ev[ery]- all sorts of factors go into health and there's no reason to talk about one rather than another so that they they combined them all together
sw2041A-ms98-a-0077 335.006375 341.815750 and uh so it's had that orientation for quite sometime um there's been some progressive medical schools out here
sw2041A-ms98-a-0078 341.815750 345.422625 that have taken that approach and um
sw2041A-ms98-a-0079 345.422625 357.560000 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0080 357.560000 371.296125 boy yeah that there's a i- i can say there's a correlation but i couldn't say which which caused the other they sort of dev[eloped]- you know each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more and a little bit more
sw2041A-ms98-a-0081 371.296125 373.672375 yeah and s[ome]-
sw2041A-ms98-a-0082 373.672375 380.314625 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0083 380.314625 382.287375 yeah yeah exactly
sw2041A-ms98-a-0084 382.287375 395.637625 and part of it is California you know in back in the sixties had a lot of alternative movements and some of them fizzled out and some of them were disastrous and others of them um had an impact on the society around here and one of the ones that had an impact was
sw2041A-ms98-a-0085 395.637625 398.012125 um people becoming interested in alternate
sw2041A-ms98-a-0086 398.012125 401.876250 practices i don't know if it was a meditation practice or sure it was you know
sw2041A-ms98-a-0087 401.876250 412.564250 which is similar to a stress management practice or alternates to uh AMA approved medicine um you have you know major um acupuncture schools and things out here and
sw2041A-ms98-a-0088 412.564250 419.738375 and you could have them around long enough and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things and before long
sw2041A-ms98-a-0089 419.738375 426.531000 you you get this this whole kind of Gestalt this whole package of of health of health care and options
sw2041A-ms98-a-0090 426.531000 430.402125 and uh and exercise is is strongly considered one of them
sw2041A-ms98-a-0091 430.402125 435.945000 the irony is is it's people in the cities in my experience that are most oriented
sw2041A-ms98-a-0092 435.945000 437.198625 towards
sw2041A-ms98-a-0093 437.198625 450.306125 doing the exercises and i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks the average person out on the farm at least traditionally now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything but at least traditionally the laborers last thing pardon me
sw2041A-ms98-a-0094 450.306125 456.825750 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0095 456.825750 462.662750 oh like everything else yeah yeah the rat race to exercise [laughter]

sw2041A-ms98-a-0099 476.984250 485.081750 yeah well i- i think so i mean you you've if you look at cert[ain]- if you look at other cultures like i know a little bit about
sw2041A-ms98-a-0100 485.081750 499.369375 people who were considered very healthy in China and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all but they do a lot of low keyed low impact low stress exercise and they combine it with a you know meditation or whatever some sort of relaxation and
sw2041A-ms98-a-0101 499.369375 511.936375 they seem pretty you know they don't have the hard body they don't have that perfect look and an awful lot of exercises is sort of image conscious but they you know they live to a hundred and ten some day [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and that that's
sw2041A-ms98-a-0102 511.936375 521.606875 and a lot of that is diet that's true yeah i mean they eat they eat a lot of carbohydrates and not much fat um for economical reasons not for preference um
sw2041A-ms98-a-0103 521.606875 525.991625 [silence]
sw2041A-ms98-a-0104 525.991625 529.686625 yes as am i actually i as am i

sw2041A-ms98-a-0107 537.366750 544.490750 it is in the urban areas yes most for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now
sw2041A-ms98-a-0108 544.490750 548.614125 well most most mo[dern]- sort of modern looking restaurants will
sw2041A-ms98-a-0109 548.614125 549.952375 you can

sw2041A-ms98-a-0111 553.746750 560.005000 i was wondering that because i was actually applying for a job in Texas and and and uh it occurred to me
