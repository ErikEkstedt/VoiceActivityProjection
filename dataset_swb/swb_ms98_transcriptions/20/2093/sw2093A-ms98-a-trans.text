sw2093A-ms98-a-0031 166.317000 177.627750 well i'm not sure what she does i i first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because_1 she starts and goes all the way across you know back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of of afghan
sw2093A-ms98-a-0032 177.627750 181.020500 i guess that's your standard knitting isn't it

sw2093A-ms98-a-0049 235.259125 241.943250 i think i had four uh jalapeno plants last year i think one of them_1 died but i i got
sw2093A-ms98-a-0050 241.943250 252.103500 s[o]- you know i put them_1 i chop them_1 up and put them_1 in jars and usually give them_1 away because_1 i do[n't]- there's no way that i can eat all those and nobody else in the family likes them_1 but always got to keep those planted
sw2093A-ms98-a-0051 252.103500 255.036125 [silence]
sw2093A-ms98-a-0052 255.036125 257.984125 well that's kind of the way i am um 
sw2093A-ms98-a-0053 257.984125 266.392500 i planted uh zucchini last year uh i planted four hills of them_1 i think i had three or four s[eeds]- seeds in each one of them_1 
sw2093A-ms98-a-0054 266.392500 272.072625 and those things just flat took over um it wasn't -[un]til late
sw2093A-ms98-a-0055 272.072625 274.098250 i guess in the summer
sw2093A-ms98-a-0056 274.098250 284.491750 maybe it was because_1 it was too dry they finally started making zucchini and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is if if they should be planted early or later it seems like all i got was
sw2093A-ms98-a-0057 284.491750 286.348000 [silence]
sw2093A-ms98-a-0058 286.348000 300.150500 i would think so um seems like these all they all went to uh to leaf and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit so i don't know if i'm mom would say you planted them in the wrong sign of the moon you know but i don't
sw2093A-ms98-a-0059 300.150500 303.942625 i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is
