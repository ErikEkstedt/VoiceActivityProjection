sw2083B-ms98-a-0089 289.074625 295.067250 i guess really the most times i've been camping would i ha[ve]- i would have to say it would be Colorado and New Mexico in that area
sw2083B-ms98-a-0090 295.067250 302.494500 just on a big group trip thing and i didn't have to come up with much equipment because a for the group we got all the stuff that we needed
sw2083B-ms98-a-0091 302.494500 303.985500 but um
sw2083B-ms98-a-0092 303.985500 310.142125 and that was boy that was a while back when i did that actually [laughter-it's] probably been ten years ago [laughter]
sw2083B-ms98-a-0093 310.142125 323.333625 but it was quite i just can remember sleeping in this sleeping bag and waking up in the middle of the night just freezing cold i mean i just you couldn't stay warm at night no matter what and i was sleeping on my my down jacket with my pillow and
sw2083B-ms98-a-0094 323.333625 334.020875 sleeping in long johns and freezing but during the day it would get nice enough and then after that week of being up there i can remember coming back down to our base camp area at at the lake at Pagosa Springs
sw2083B-ms98-a-0095 334.020875 342.933125 and we all made a beeline for this pump because_1 there weren't any there were just outhouses and a pump and we all went to the pump and we were all washing our hair under the pump
sw2083B-ms98-a-0096 342.933125 355.722250 and it was so cold it must have been like thirty three degree water that just was all but frozen and it gave us the worse headaches we've ever had in our lives it was so nice just to at least get clean hair and we all jumped in the lake and everything just to just to rinse [laughter-off]
sw2083B-ms98-a-0097 355.722250 365.315000 it was quite an experience i've never gone for a whole week in the wilderness with with no you know no running water nothing so it was pretty pretty uh interesting experience
sw2083B-ms98-a-0098 365.315000 367.629625 definitely [laughter]
sw2083B-ms98-a-0099 367.629625 372.534250 definitely i mean when you appreciate an outhouse you know you've been [laughter-roughing] it [laughter]
sw2083B-ms98-a-0100 372.534250 378.094250 but anyway well five minute well actually we've gone more than five minutes so
