sw2020A-ms98-a-0033 161.194375 169.882500 and uh sounds th[e]- sounds so much different and yet i i have a a much younger sister who listens to a a lot of rap music and
sw2020A-ms98-a-0034 169.882500 180.961625 uh she thinks it's pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to and yet she thought they were brand new original pieces

sw2020A-ms98-a-0043 221.259875 228.303375 may[be]- maybe it wasn't that one then because_1 it's a living it was a living person that i'm that i'm thinking of that um that said you know hey
sw2020A-ms98-a-0044 228.303375 239.948500 that's those are my words [laughter] and uh i guess that they're they because he hadn't originally gotten um permission from him to use it and he he since then has has amended that and
sw2020A-ms98-a-0045 239.948500 243.982375 paid them his royalties every time the the song goes on but [laughter]
