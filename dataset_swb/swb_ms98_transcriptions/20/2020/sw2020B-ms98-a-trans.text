sw2020B-ms98-a-0013 64.241375 73.493750 i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to but the uh th[ere's]- there's such a wide selection i think i like a lot
sw2020B-ms98-a-0014 73.493750 77.841250 or i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music you know i i i[t]-
sw2020B-ms98-a-0015 77.841250 90.706750 i i like music that is that that i feel if it's performed correctly or if it's done right or if the version is done [laughter-right] i like it but if it if it's not then i won't [laughter] i i really don't
sw2020B-ms98-a-0016 90.706750 92.768000 rap
sw2020B-ms98-a-0017 92.768000 101.141250 yeah well i i don't really have anything against rap music i d[o]- the one thing i do object to about rap music is is i[t]-
sw2020B-ms98-a-0018 101.141250 110.577875 when it becomes militant or if it's uh violence oriented i i'm i- i r[eally]- i have i have strong objections to that um
sw2020B-ms98-a-0019 110.577875 117.295625 actually i listened to one time i -[re]member it's this is back when r[ap]- even
sw2020B-ms98-a-0020 117.295625 121.608500 uh i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i
sw2020B-ms98-a-0021 121.608500 124.498375 yeah right when it was just starting i heard
sw2020B-ms98-a-0022 124.498375 138.557500 what was called talking blues which actually is rap and uh it was about [laughter-the] the piece of mus[ic]- the piece of music was about i think about forty or fifty years old and it was incredible i mean the parallels you know between it and rap
sw2020B-ms98-a-0023 138.557500 151.291875 and um you you listen a lot if you l[isten]- if you l[isten]- hear a lot of old gospel um uh especially_1 well the black gospel you know you will you know you can really pick it up i mean it y[ou]-
sw2020B-ms98-a-0024 151.291875 157.753125 [silence]

sw2020B-ms98-a-0031 180.249125 193.633375 they they do copy versions they do cover versions of of you know like standards i guess you could call it [laughter-yeah] [laughter-so] i think it's kind of absurd you know the fact that you know they don't really they don't really
sw2020B-ms98-a-0032 193.633375 200.539250 give you know the original artist or the original composer the credit that's really due to them
sw2020B-ms98-a-0033 200.539250 205.491750 [silence]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0034 205.491750 207.196750 yeah

sw2020B-ms98-a-0038 215.103125 220.522375 yeah it Jimi Hendrix was the original Jimi Hendrix was the original he wrote

sw2020B-ms98-a-0044 239.243375 243.741875 [laughter]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0045 243.741875 253.347000 yeah i don't know it may've it may've been somebody else because i th[ink]- i think that even Jimi Hendrix did a i think that was a cov[er]- i you know come to think of it i think that was a cover version of
sw2020B-ms98-a-0046 253.347000 257.815250 like a John Lee Hooker song or something i mean it was like it was really old
sw2020B-ms98-a-0047 257.815250 266.220625 i mean i i it it a l[ot]- there're a lot so many different songs i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times i mean i've heard some songs that
sw2020B-ms98-a-0048 266.220625 276.749125 that i just thought were horrendous cover versions and i'm like you know i i don't wanna [laughter-listen] [laughter-to] [laughter-this] [laughter] because you know you think of the original it's like you know oh that was really great that was a you know
sw2020B-ms98-a-0049 276.749125 289.997750 really good piece of work and then y[ou]- when you hear the cover it's like you know God you know what what are they doing [laughter-to] [laughter-this] [laughter] oh i th[ink]- i think a good one was um there was a Peter Frampton song
sw2020B-ms98-a-0050 289.997750 297.266375 y[eah]- and then the cover version i think i mean i thought was absolu[tely]- it was pitiful [laughter]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0051 297.266375 299.260000 [silence]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0052 299.260000 313.998375 yeah there's [laughter] yeah but you know whatever became of Peter Frampton i mean there was nothing he was a phenomenon i mean there was no reason for him to really come into you know great stardom or anything
sw2020B-ms98-a-0053 313.998375 323.174625 yeah yeah i i think i think that prob[ably]- yeah i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer
sw2020B-ms98-a-0054 323.174625 325.367875 yeah
sw2020B-ms98-a-0055 325.367875 327.478250 [silence]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0056 327.478250 331.701875 [laughter] oh man
sw2020B-ms98-a-0057 331.701875 341.196875 [laughter] yeah i've i i graduated back in seventy nine so but but i really i i loved i mean i was
sw2020B-ms98-a-0058 341.196875 354.029375 i was really into the album oriented music even then so i was really familiar with a lot of with a lot of the AOR type music um the the album oriented like the uh James Taylor and
sw2020B-ms98-a-0059 354.029375 364.163625 the uh the Beatles and you know i mean a lot of people they go you know they're better than the Beatles and i'm like you know [laughter-you] [laughter-you] [laughter-don't] [laughter-know] [laughter-what] [laughter-you're] [laughter-talking] [laughter-about]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0060 364.163625 372.519750 [laughter] oh i mean you know c[omparison]- the comparison made between New Kids on the Block with The Beatles [laughter-i] [laughter-mean] [laughter-it] [laughter-was] [laughter-just]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0061 372.519750 381.472125 [laughter] yeah you just sort of you know well i guess i can just humor them you [laughter] know [laughter-at] [laughter-this] [laughter-point] but 
sw2020B-ms98-a-0062 381.472125 382.577625 [silence]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0063 382.577625 395.050500 yeah but we[ll]- well you know i mean i i've i liked a lot of the new music i think um um when i saw some promise you know with with a lot of the new wave when it when it came out um back in the
sw2020B-ms98-a-0064 395.050500 397.796000 in the mid and early eighties and then
sw2020B-ms98-a-0065 397.796000 408.054125 um i don't know music is kind of in a weird it it it's in a very weird position right now i think that i mean i like you know things like to hear you know like what they call world music
sw2020B-ms98-a-0066 408.054125 422.521125 which is you know using all these natural forms of music and yeah yeah Paul Simon well you know really that's not world music but w[hat]- what Paul Simon's doing i think is is is is great because he's
sw2020B-ms98-a-0067 422.521125 434.917125 uh you know i think i think that you know using a i guess what they call it is eclectic you know u[sing]- drawing from a lot of different sources and making you know a a synthesis of a new type of music um
sw2020B-ms98-a-0068 434.917125 441.196375 well world music is um a lot of the a lot of
sw2020B-ms98-a-0069 441.196375 454.835250 where they where they make music that they adapt to a to another kind of to another type of listener uh for example let's say you're taking like an original Brazilian form of music
sw2020B-ms98-a-0070 454.835250 461.392125 a with a certain style and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for
sw2020B-ms98-a-0071 461.392125 475.647125 let's say another audience let's say a North American and then when they hear it it it it's a really it's another form of music and you know it's sort of um trying to draw out the best sources the the best of every type of music
sw2020B-ms98-a-0072 475.647125 489.156625 because i mean there are some i mean i l[ike]- there are some you know types of heavy metal that i really like but but i wouldn't i wouldn't say that i i completely like heavy metal i i think you know i[t]- and it's the same way with w[orld]- you know world music takes
sw2020B-ms98-a-0073 489.156625 496.230500 the forms that have really been um i guess i you know the best example or you know
sw2020B-ms98-a-0074 496.230500 509.998000 the cream of the crop i guess you could say and then and then taking those those qualities and then applying in the styles that are really um that extremely enjoyable and then taking
sw2020B-ms98-a-0075 509.998000 511.109875 [silence]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0076 511.109875 517.298375 yeah yeah it becomes a kind of music of it's own i mean when you listen to it it's um
sw2020B-ms98-a-0077 517.298375 524.593250 uh i think that they don't use elec[tronic]- el[ectronic]- some of it it's it's they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably
sw2020B-ms98-a-0078 524.593250 529.999000 so you know well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from South Africa now
sw2020B-ms98-a-0079 529.999000 539.384000 and from West Africa that's considered world music because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles
sw2020B-ms98-a-0080 539.384000 547.665000 but they're they're trying to make it somewhat more modern i i a a good ex[ample]- another good example was i heard Miles Davis
sw2020B-ms98-a-0081 547.665000 557.801750 and Miles Davis worked with Ravi Shankar if you can believe it [laughter] i mean you know he's this jazz performer and then he's playing with Ravi Shankar who's a very good
sw2020B-ms98-a-0082 557.801750 562.642000 he's a very good arranger uh [vocalized-noise] arrangement to [vocalized-noise]
sw2020B-ms98-a-0083 562.642000 575.960375 but uh were going to get off [vocalized-noise] [laughter] i don't know but no yeah okay but yeah i mean when i heard his album when i heard it and it's just incredible
sw2020B-ms98-a-0084 575.960375 585.547125 yeah i i listened and i heard you know you hear this sitar and then you hear this the muted trumpet and i mean you never th[ink]- would think that they that they can actually play together but
