sw2007B-ms98-a-0003 4.667625 12.573375 well i guess without a doubt we'd have to say automobiles although i suppose manufacturing contributes uh quite a bit to air pollution
sw2007B-ms98-a-0004 12.573375 26.843375 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0005 26.843375 34.366375 uh y[eah]- yeah you know i'm wondering uh course uh Freon is uh is uh eating away at our
sw2007B-ms98-a-0006 34.366375 38.303500 uh what you call that layer there ozone layer
sw2007B-ms98-a-0007 38.303500 39.450875 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0008 39.450875 44.331875 i wonder when they're gonna what they'll be able to use in pro[pane]- in place of Freon

sw2007B-ms98-a-0012 65.527375 69.759250 uh well actually you know that is the way a refrigerator works
sw2007B-ms98-a-0013 69.759250 73.466375 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0014 73.466375 77.520250 well basically what happens is you have to have some form of heat
sw2007B-ms98-a-0015 77.520250 83.611625 be it electrical as in your home refrigerator or propane as the one on the ship that you said
sw2007B-ms98-a-0016 83.611625 90.470750 uh you had and uh somehow cr[eated]- heat must be created that Freon
sw2007B-ms98-a-0017 90.470750 95.785500 oh i'm not exactly sure what happens but apparently it expands in the heat and
sw2007B-ms98-a-0018 95.785500 103.862875 in the process of expanding it goes through cooler coils and whatnot and it becomes fr[ozen]- c[old]- uh ice cold
sw2007B-ms98-a-0019 103.862875 106.201750 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0020 106.201750 111.078875 oh yes yes Freon's uh Freon is in a closed circuit
sw2007B-ms98-a-0021 111.078875 112.151750 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0022 112.151750 119.509875 uh that's why our present day refrigerants uh systems are not dangerous unless the lines are broken
sw2007B-ms98-a-0023 119.509875 123.421125 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0024 123.421125 130.818125 w[ell]- well did you ever see what happens when they uh replace the or replenish the Freon in your automobile air conditioner
sw2007B-ms98-a-0025 130.818125 136.258125 i mean there's uh a lot of it is uh turned out into the atmosphere
sw2007B-ms98-a-0026 136.258125 144.154750 and i understand now uh i don't know if it's international or just here in Texas or what but uh
sw2007B-ms98-a-0027 144.154750 149.042250 service stations are going to require to have a special device
sw2007B-ms98-a-0028 149.042250 154.115125 to catch this Freon as it is ex[pelled]- expelled the excess Freon
sw2007B-ms98-a-0029 154.115125 160.145625 and therefore you won't be able to just pull in anywhere to or you wouldn't even be able to do it yourself at home
sw2007B-ms98-a-0030 160.145625 179.650625 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0031 179.650625 181.193375 no that's true
sw2007B-ms98-a-0032 181.193375 182.196750 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0033 182.196750 185.361875 you know i can remember as a child uh
sw2007B-ms98-a-0034 185.361875 190.504000 spending summers at my grandfather's place and i'd be running around with nothing but a bathing suit
sw2007B-ms98-a-0035 190.504000 193.155750 no shoes socks shirts or anything
sw2007B-ms98-a-0036 193.155750 195.981875 uh i mean from dawn till dusk
sw2007B-ms98-a-0037 195.981875 202.420625 and i develop a nice tan but uh my gosh it never had to worry about uh skin cancer
sw2007B-ms98-a-0038 202.420625 203.471750 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0039 203.471750 209.742750 or for that matter you could stop at any stream that looked reasonably clear and and get a drink of water without worrying a[bout]-
sw2007B-ms98-a-0040 209.742750 212.226375 about_1 catching some disease
sw2007B-ms98-a-0041 212.226375 232.077250 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0042 232.077250 233.838250 hm yeah yeah

sw2007B-ms98-a-0044 236.874875 241.158375 i tell you funny thing happened to me with with polluted water
sw2007B-ms98-a-0045 241.158375 248.583500 uh TI sent me up on a trip to Wyoming i think it was and i was out in this little
sw2007B-ms98-a-0046 248.583500 255.824875 town kind of backwoods town you know uh where big night on the town is going down watching the traffic light change
sw2007B-ms98-a-0047 255.824875 256.825375 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0048 256.825375 259.932750 but uh i checked into a motel
sw2007B-ms98-a-0049 259.932750 265.523000 and after i signed in and everything why the uh clerk told me uh don't drink the water
sw2007B-ms98-a-0050 265.523000 267.463125 it's contaminated
sw2007B-ms98-a-0051 267.463125 275.295875 he said now we do have bottled water we supply to our guests but unfortunately we're out of it right now but as as soon as we get it
sw2007B-ms98-a-0052 275.295875 277.833750 i['ll]- i'll see that you get a bottle of it
sw2007B-ms98-a-0053 277.833750 284.652875 well the next morning i got up the water had not been delivered yet and would you believe it i brushed my teeth with Coca-Cola
sw2007B-ms98-a-0054 284.652875 285.894000 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0055 285.894000 286.964625 [laughter]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0056 286.964625 290.620625 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0057 290.620625 293.290875 oh well th[ey]- they had this uh
sw2007B-ms98-a-0058 293.290875 294.362000 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0059 294.362000 298.895250 it's uh some kind of a bacteria call[ed]- or carried by animals
sw2007B-ms98-a-0060 298.895250 304.000875 and it they got their water from this uh beautiful mountain river
sw2007B-ms98-a-0061 304.000875 307.829375 well maybe not quite a river but a little bigger than a stream
sw2007B-ms98-a-0062 307.829375 313.000375 but this uh bacteria had uh penetrated their entire
sw2007B-ms98-a-0063 313.000375 315.765250 pipe system or water system
sw2007B-ms98-a-0064 315.765250 319.984000 and they tried flushing it out they they couldn't get rid of it
sw2007B-ms98-a-0065 319.984000 326.555875 i've often wondered now this is years ago and i've often wondered what they ever did course the oh was a beautiful mountain stream
sw2007B-ms98-a-0066 326.555875 332.481375 bubbling nicely you know the which uh is what purifies water when it bubbles
sw2007B-ms98-a-0067 332.481375 334.589250 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0068 334.589250 338.302000 yes and yet even at that it was still contaminated
sw2007B-ms98-a-0069 338.302000 346.153875 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0070 346.153875 349.368875 [laughter-yeah] [laughter-yes]

sw2007B-ms98-a-0072 353.655375 359.558000 well i'm beginning to wonder too i mean you g[et]- you're always hearing stories about well the government okayed this
sw2007B-ms98-a-0073 359.558000 361.494000 then all of a sudden you turn around and
sw2007B-ms98-a-0074 361.494000 367.984250 my gosh it's okay for to doing it this way but if you turn around and do it that way it's dangerous
sw2007B-ms98-a-0075 367.984250 378.238125 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0076 378.238125 380.150125 as a matter of fact i did
sw2007B-ms98-a-0077 380.150125 382.129125 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0078 382.129125 383.309375 neither have i

sw2007B-ms98-a-0083 406.632125 412.878875 i've often wondered about the LA now that's supposed to be about the worst c[ity]- city in the country i guess for
sw2007B-ms98-a-0084 412.878875 414.229875 air pollution
sw2007B-ms98-a-0085 414.229875 426.679625 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0086 426.679625 428.516250 uh yeah um-hum

sw2007B-ms98-a-0088 436.791125 438.010000 well
sw2007B-ms98-a-0089 438.010000 442.957250 uh they used to do it down in Florida now i lived down there for ten years
sw2007B-ms98-a-0090 442.957250 447.191625 no they did away with it because they found out that uh
sw2007B-ms98-a-0091 447.191625 450.462875 the people that were doing it it was just a racket to them
sw2007B-ms98-a-0092 450.462875 456.558375 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0093 456.558375 459.587875 and for n[othing]- uh for nothing [vocalized-noise] too
sw2007B-ms98-a-0094 459.587875 461.387750 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0095 461.387750 462.870500 yeah

sw2007B-ms98-a-0097 475.964625 479.767000 um-hum well now here's another thing diesels
sw2007B-ms98-a-0098 479.767000 483.578125 uh diesel engines are uh the worst 
sw2007B-ms98-a-0099 483.578125 486.104875 and yet they haven't done a thing to them
sw2007B-ms98-a-0100 486.104875 500.855250 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0101 500.855250 506.066625 uh-huh yeah t[ell]- t[ell]- tell me about it i just got rid of a a diesel engine Escort 
sw2007B-ms98-a-0102 506.066625 511.505000 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0103 511.505000 517.780500 well i um i i had good luck with mine until it finally just blew up on me here a few weeks ago 
sw2007B-ms98-a-0104 517.780500 523.453125 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0105 523.453125 525.443000 is that right well
sw2007B-ms98-a-0106 525.443000 533.316375 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0107 533.316375 537.552875 uh-huh well now there was at one time
sw2007B-ms98-a-0108 537.552875 542.947000 as a matter of fact it may have been Buick i think because_1 i think it was GM that came out with a
sw2007B-ms98-a-0109 542.947000 543.969000 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0110 543.969000 548.898875 [disea[l]-/diesel] uh diesel engine that was converted from a gas engine
sw2007B-ms98-a-0111 548.898875 554.862375 and uh they used the same pistons and and cylinders and whatnot but all they did was change the uh
sw2007B-ms98-a-0112 554.862375 560.076500 uh the induction ports and and etcetera etcetera whatever needed to be changed over
sw2007B-ms98-a-0113 560.076500 565.695375 and although they were it seemed practical at the time they were nothing but a headache
sw2007B-ms98-a-0114 565.695375 569.260875 and they did aw[ay]- w[ent]- t[o]- we[nt]- finally did away with them_1 and went to a straight diesel
sw2007B-ms98-a-0115 569.260875 577.346250 [silence]
sw2007B-ms98-a-0116 577.346250 583.129000 well now course in California they're they have much stricter codes than we have elsewhere
sw2007B-ms98-a-0117 583.129000 587.422375 now could be that we could do the same thing that they're doing out in California
sw2007B-ms98-a-0118 587.422375 592.101125 i don't know what it is precisely but uh they're doing they do something
sw2007B-ms98-a-0119 592.101125 594.074250 a little more stricter than we do
sw2007B-ms98-a-0120 594.074250 599.819000 [silence]
