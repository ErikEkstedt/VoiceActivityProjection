sw2007A-ms98-a-0004 11.942625 19.126750 yeah i i i think cars are probably one of the biggest offenders but then there's like you say there's industry
sw2007A-ms98-a-0005 19.126750 24.364375 with all the uh sulfur and all that other stuff they're dumping out into the atmosphere

sw2007A-ms98-a-0013 52.532250 55.109375 but on the other hand you know i i've
sw2007A-ms98-a-0014 55.109375 61.792250 um i took a boat cruise one time and it had a refrigerator on board and it was powered by propane

sw2007A-ms98-a-0037 161.577750 169.753625 i i'm more worried about the ozone than i am anything else i i i think we're getting a handle on sulfur dioxides and
sw2007A-ms98-a-0038 169.753625 176.098750 all that kind of stuff uh cooperating with the Canadians on the acid rain problem
sw2007A-ms98-a-0039 176.098750 180.206000 but the ozone i mean you know we can't replace that [laughter]

sw2007A-ms98-a-0089 382.880125 388.123875 yeah i i couldn't i couldn't bear to think about eating a chicken after seeing that
sw2007A-ms98-a-0090 388.123875 391.050625 and but the government says it's safe uh-huh
sw2007A-ms98-a-0091 391.050625 396.157250 right that's about what they say about the the air pollution in this country
sw2007A-ms98-a-0092 396.157250 404.608125 and they s[ay]- s[ay]- -[y]eah it's getting better it's getting better and then you turn around and you look and places like Los Angeles is s[till]- still so thick you have to cut it with a knife

sw2007A-ms98-a-0097 419.770875 427.098125 uh you had to have your car checked for pollution every year you had to have that little sticker in the window i know Texas does
sw2007A-ms98-a-0098 427.098125 431.091750 and there are about three places in Georgia that does

sw2007A-ms98-a-0108 465.875375 473.797750 i mean you look at the cars driving down the road and you look at these things belching huge blue clouds of oil smoke
