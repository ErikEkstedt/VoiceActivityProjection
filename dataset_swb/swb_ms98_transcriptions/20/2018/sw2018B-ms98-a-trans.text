sw2018B-ms98-a-0014 35.502375 37.364375 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0015 37.364375 40.454000 okay yes
sw2018B-ms98-a-0016 40.454000 44.453000 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0017 44.453000 46.610375 yes i know because_1
sw2018B-ms98-a-0018 46.610375 58.979875 i know when my mother was a you know going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her i guess she's in her late forties you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids and i've never faced that at all
sw2018B-ms98-a-0019 58.979875 64.027250 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0020 64.027250 65.846125 uh-huh
sw2018B-ms98-a-0021 65.846125 71.121625 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0022 71.121625 75.235000 yeah um-hum i think it's definitely gotten better
sw2018B-ms98-a-0023 75.235000 77.039625 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0024 77.039625 78.865625 um-hum
sw2018B-ms98-a-0025 78.865625 84.250750 because_1 women are in every field now i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in
sw2018B-ms98-a-0026 84.250750 86.157375 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0027 86.157375 99.835625 i know at least in the medical field it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field i don't think that men really took the time to work on that [laughter-sort] [laughter-of] [laughter-thing]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0028 99.835625 100.877625 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0029 100.877625 102.595000 yeah
sw2018B-ms98-a-0030 102.595000 104.408375 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0031 104.408375 113.991000 hopefully the next generation it won't even be an issue i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman i think that would be the best goal
sw2018B-ms98-a-0032 113.991000 114.996750 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0033 114.996750 125.076375 uh-huh exactly not what color you are how old you are what if your male or female that would be wonderful i guess it's kind of an ideal world though huh
sw2018B-ms98-a-0034 125.076375 127.208625 [laughter]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0035 127.208625 130.365875 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0036 130.365875 131.911625 yeah
sw2018B-ms98-a-0037 131.911625 135.942875 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0038 135.942875 143.123750 exactly or the way you look or the way you you know your age or anything i think that'd be a wonderful way to do it
sw2018B-ms98-a-0039 143.123750 146.316625 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0040 146.316625 148.305875 um-hum
sw2018B-ms98-a-0041 148.305875 150.021625 and then
sw2018B-ms98-a-0042 150.021625 151.381750 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0043 151.381750 152.759250 um-hum
sw2018B-ms98-a-0044 152.759250 164.529750 also with uh women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as you know what's it called job sharing like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job or
sw2018B-ms98-a-0045 164.529750 166.499125 is it
sw2018B-ms98-a-0046 166.499125 168.867125 that would be great
sw2018B-ms98-a-0047 168.867125 178.358750 or a lot of women i know now and my uh one of my supervisors when she went on LOA to have her baby we hooked up a a a terminal at her house
sw2018B-ms98-a-0048 178.358750 190.673375 and sh[e]- you know we could send her messages and and she kept in touch like that and basically just worked out of her house i would just take her the actual paperwork once uh every week or two and that worked out great too
sw2018B-ms98-a-0049 190.673375 201.221000 i mean that's a real attractive option if you have the the technology for it all it was was you know i mean she just used a phone modem and she was like she was sitting in the office
sw2018B-ms98-a-0050 201.221000 206.210000 so i think that's real nice too to come up with different options do you like the job sharing
sw2018B-ms98-a-0051 206.210000 208.020750 do you
sw2018B-ms98-a-0052 208.020750 211.928250 do you work like half days or half weeks or
sw2018B-ms98-a-0053 211.928250 213.463625 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0054 213.463625 214.867625 hm
sw2018B-ms98-a-0055 214.867625 217.067500 [silence]

sw2018B-ms98-a-0059 224.002250 226.277250 oh that's wonderful
sw2018B-ms98-a-0060 226.277250 228.174875 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0061 228.174875 234.148250 yeah especially_1 with children and so many things going on that would be great
sw2018B-ms98-a-0062 234.148250 237.417000 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0063 237.417000 245.030500 either way yeah [noise] you have your career and your home life and that'd be a nice way to especially_1 if you have young children
sw2018B-ms98-a-0064 245.030500 246.652750 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0065 246.652750 248.228500 um-hum
sw2018B-ms98-a-0066 248.228500 249.413875 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0067 249.413875 260.653625 oh no i think yeah my son's just in day care but even that they have extracurricular activities and the older they get the more that you're involved in that
sw2018B-ms98-a-0068 260.653625 262.481875 yeah
sw2018B-ms98-a-0069 262.481875 263.895125 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0070 263.895125 274.803875 [noise] i do too especially as women get up in management and and can be in on those decision making you know when that subject comes up they can say yes that would be wonderful
sw2018B-ms98-a-0071 274.803875 285.777625 plus i bet it cuts [vocalized-noise] cuts down on your absenteeism because_1 you've got two days off that you can do everything so you don't have to you know unless you're just really sick or the child's sick 
sw2018B-ms98-a-0072 285.777625 288.952750 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0073 288.952750 302.090750 um-hum oh yeah i have to plan way in advance because or what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours that's been real helpful too like my doctor stays open till nine in the evening
sw2018B-ms98-a-0074 302.090750 314.402750 so that's real helpful so you don't [vocalized-noise] you know have to do it during office hours run out on your lunch hour i don't know how many times i've done that to do [laughter-something] post office or the bank or any uh kind of errand 
sw2018B-ms98-a-0075 314.402750 316.171250 so
sw2018B-ms98-a-0076 316.171250 323.449500 uh-huh i guess i take it for granted kind of because_1 i just it's always been that way but i know
sw2018B-ms98-a-0077 323.449500 330.501875 [silence]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0078 330.501875 339.774625 oh no i can remember my mother getting in trouble if you know one of us was sick and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything you know compared to the work that she did
sw2018B-ms98-a-0079 339.774625 352.374375 i think there's still some discrimination there where as you know men and wor[k]- women work in the same job i think men get paid more but i think that's improving it's such a slow process it's frustrating but
sw2018B-ms98-a-0080 352.374375 358.607375 mean you can see that it's wrong and you just wanna make it right but at least the wheels are moving forward 
sw2018B-ms98-a-0081 358.607375 362.755750 yeah i think it's getting better not worse
sw2018B-ms98-a-0082 362.755750 368.065625 well i should probably get back to my job [laughter]
sw2018B-ms98-a-0083 368.065625 370.215875 [noise] call again
sw2018B-ms98-a-0084 370.215875 372.147125 okay bye-bye
sw2018B-ms98-a-0085 372.147125 372.862500 [noise]
