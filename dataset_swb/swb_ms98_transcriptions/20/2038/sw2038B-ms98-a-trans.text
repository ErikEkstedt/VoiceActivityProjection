sw2038B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.682750 [noise]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0002 0.682750 2.859250 okay i guess we're on
sw2038B-ms98-a-0003 2.859250 5.768000 Central America have you ever lived in Central America
sw2038B-ms98-a-0004 5.768000 18.098250 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0005 18.098250 21.982375 do you do you think that that we should have given up the Panama Canal
sw2038B-ms98-a-0006 21.982375 49.855250 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0007 49.855250 57.320250 well there are those that that that think that that that the Panama Canal has some considerable strategic
sw2038B-ms98-a-0008 57.320250 62.741250 importance particularly for the military interestingly enough my father was who was in World War Two 
sw2038B-ms98-a-0009 62.741250 67.839625 and as uh as a civil engineer they they they offered him a commission as a captain
sw2038B-ms98-a-0010 67.839625 73.733750 if he would uh go in and and uh help with the defenses of the Panama Canal he had worked with United Fruit Company
sw2038B-ms98-a-0011 73.733750 82.786875 there and they uh they in fact they had this was in uh the late twenties and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over
sw2038B-ms98-a-0012 82.786875 90.520750 and uh he turned them_1 down it it's interesting that that most people don't realize how small the canal is have you ever been there
sw2038B-ms98-a-0013 90.520750 93.993250 it's it's really i i haven't been th[ere]- i've been to been to Salvador and
sw2038B-ms98-a-0014 93.993250 100.594000 and uh in fact we went back to visit some friends of of of my fathers that we went in fifty seven i guess
sw2038B-ms98-a-0015 100.594000 106.893500 and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and and realistically could be sabotaged quite
sw2038B-ms98-a-0016 106.893500 116.755000 quite easily the thing i find interesting though is that uh is the whole colonial approach and and and do we do we support the Sandinistas or
sw2038B-ms98-a-0017 116.755000 119.556250 or do we support uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0018 119.556250 126.224500 you know when they thought uh they thought that Nicaragua if you gave them_1 a free election they would vote for the
sw2038B-ms98-a-0019 126.224500 132.245000 will you uh d[id]- did you ever studied the the political makeup there in in in Nicaragua
sw2038B-ms98-a-0020 132.245000 216.700125 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0021 216.700125 226.137000 well the interesting part about it is that if realistically it was economic i don't know if you read any of the history on where the Panama Canal but there was an option to build it across Nicaragua
sw2038B-ms98-a-0022 226.137000 230.997625 uh and there were uh there's a big there's a big lake
sw2038B-ms98-a-0023 230.997625 243.538500 and um from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in Nicaragua but the the United States uh had some and i've forgotten what the political influence was
sw2038B-ms98-a-0024 243.538500 252.019875 but there were economic ties then the issue of of of if if it's in the economic interest of the United States
sw2038B-ms98-a-0025 252.019875 261.399750 uh do we go in and and prevail and and uh in other words do we make the world a safer democracy but if there's no economic benefit
sw2038B-ms98-a-0026 261.399750 270.080500 and i think particularly if you're if you're looking at the at the at the peasant uh whether he's in Central America regardless of where he is
sw2038B-ms98-a-0027 270.080500 279.091125 is his life [vocalized-noise] is his life better off under Communism or or uh or Democratic government you look at Salvador where the
sw2038B-ms98-a-0028 279.091125 282.652750 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0029 282.652750 287.311250 yeah and and the question is is does the government make a difference if they'll mostly leave him alone
sw2038B-ms98-a-0030 287.311250 294.416875 uh and i think that's the difficulty they that that we have that uh it it it reality doesn't make uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0031 294.416875 299.347375 doesn't make a difference if he has no income and apparently even some of our alleged uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0032 299.347375 308.298625 Central American leaders that uh a[re]- are that are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things so it's uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0033 308.298625 355.382875 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0034 355.382875 364.564750 it it's it is interesting that that you know we we look at the exploitation and and and then we accuse some other people of exploiting and and and Americans
sw2038B-ms98-a-0035 364.564750 370.181375 have uh have a pretty good reputation of exploiting you know we basically the Panama Canal we went in and and took it
sw2038B-ms98-a-0036 370.181375 371.190750 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0037 371.190750 374.210625 and uh we stole it fair and [laughter-square] i think is uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0038 374.210625 380.257500 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0039 380.257500 389.454000 well what's going to be interesting is to see what the economic impact of of uh of the the region uh you know at the moment it
sw2038B-ms98-a-0040 389.454000 395.252750 the tremendous drug traffic through there but uh the idea of of uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0041 395.252750 399.433250 what's the what's America's role there and it it uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0042 399.433250 407.308125 with with other things going on it it it seems to have lessened but you've still got uh Cuba that exception exerts some influence
sw2038B-ms98-a-0043 407.308125 420.906750 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0044 420.906750 425.198750 well when you take a a situation where i think in particular in Salvador
sw2038B-ms98-a-0045 425.198750 428.813625 where there is a significant u[nder]- under class
sw2038B-ms98-a-0046 428.813625 430.121875 [noise] excuse me
sw2038B-ms98-a-0047 430.121875 434.490625 and that uh having a a a lot of difficulty
sw2038B-ms98-a-0048 434.490625 437.182750 uh surviving
sw2038B-ms98-a-0049 437.182750 439.244250 uh the question is would they
sw2038B-ms98-a-0050 439.244250 442.974125 you know would they be better off under communism
sw2038B-ms98-a-0051 442.974125 451.018375 and i wouldn't don't know that i would advocate communism but uh the question is can a can you can a can a democracy uh afford the
sw2038B-ms98-a-0052 451.018375 457.726375 it's like the street people that are starting to show up all over the US is that that's essentially an underclass and when you get enough of them_1
sw2038B-ms98-a-0053 457.726375 460.514500 uh you know Communism would feed them_1 all
sw2038B-ms98-a-0054 460.514500 486.047000 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0055 486.047000 487.683750 well that
sw2038B-ms98-a-0056 487.683750 495.096750 yeah if the guys got some incentive if he's got uh you know i[f]- if he if he can raise enough uh coffee and bananas
sw2038B-ms98-a-0057 495.096750 504.014500 to uh where he's got something to protect other you know whether he can export or at least uh set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest to him
sw2038B-ms98-a-0058 504.014500 505.596500 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0059 505.596500 507.605375 [laughter] yes [laughter]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0060 507.605375 512.585250 a[s]- as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments
sw2038B-ms98-a-0061 512.585250 526.918750 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0062 526.918750 534.369375 yes but the but the question is you know if somebody offered you you know a thousand dollars a day to to grow something in your backyard would you do it
sw2038B-ms98-a-0063 534.369375 536.386125 well not that we could be bought but uh
sw2038B-ms98-a-0064 536.386125 538.633625 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0065 538.633625 542.715625 well of course all everything we're saying is being recorded and [laughter]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0066 542.715625 543.849375 [laughter]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0067 543.849375 545.562625 of course of course
sw2038B-ms98-a-0068 545.562625 549.421250 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0069 549.421250 551.201125 particularly if you're hungry
sw2038B-ms98-a-0070 551.201125 572.365875 [silence]
sw2038B-ms98-a-0071 572.365875 578.472500 [vocalized-noise] uh starve to death is not a not a whole lot of fun either and that uh and and and
sw2038B-ms98-a-0072 578.472500 582.738500 you know when somebody comes in and offers i think that's one of the real problems particularly when
sw2038B-ms98-a-0073 582.738500 590.776875 when the uh religious organizations you know the Catholic church has been accused of a lot of things in reality i think what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people
sw2038B-ms98-a-0074 590.776875 593.272000 and help them protect themselves no[t]- not that they
sw2038B-ms98-a-0075 593.272000 598.476500 i'm i'm not sure the Catholic church is is is p[articularly]- particularly political but
sw2038B-ms98-a-0076 598.476500 599.885625 you know if somebody's hun[gry]-
