sw2040B-ms98-a-0003 10.886000 12.384500 i was a
sw2040B-ms98-a-0004 12.384500 22.664875 resident although very young of the s[tate]- of what is now the state of Alaska in nineteen fifty nine when Alaska stopped being a territory became a state
sw2040B-ms98-a-0005 22.664875 26.123875 uh so i guess i have a left over
sw2040B-ms98-a-0006 26.123875 32.230250 positive feeling about the question even though i don't know [laughter-very] much about Puerto Rico
sw2040B-ms98-a-0007 32.230250 42.356375 um i know that all the things that happened relative to that territory in Alaska have been very positive uh and i k[ind]- have a suspicion that that i
sw2040B-ms98-a-0008 42.356375 53.049875 believe that a that statehood is a good idea whenever you have a territory the size of Puerto Rico one ought either to make it a full-fledged state or or let it go one or the other
sw2040B-ms98-a-0009 53.049875 55.378750 what is your situation
sw2040B-ms98-a-0010 55.378750 99.809250 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0011 99.809250 101.683250 oh that's very interesting
sw2040B-ms98-a-0012 101.683250 131.120625 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0013 131.120625 143.418000 your concern on the economies was one in terms of if it became a state would that put even more pressures on on Puerto Rico or pressures on the US in terms of aid or
sw2040B-ms98-a-0014 143.418000 168.926500 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0015 168.926500 170.273625 um-hum

sw2040B-ms98-a-0019 193.556750 195.053750 i guess
sw2040B-ms98-a-0020 195.053750 196.286000 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0021 196.286000 205.010750 we're assuming that that Puerto Rico would be per capita significantly more poor perhaps than than say Mississippi or
sw2040B-ms98-a-0022 205.010750 206.524625 okay
sw2040B-ms98-a-0023 206.524625 211.254625 that's something th[at]- that i guess i have not much of an image of other than
sw2040B-ms98-a-0024 211.254625 219.607250 than Puerto Rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something uh not in a
sw2040B-ms98-a-0025 219.607250 228.875625 pejorative sense but in a in a carefree sense i guess although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest and and and also difficulties they have 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0026 228.875625 230.428250 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0027 230.428250 237.519000 i don't know whether state woul[d]- statehood would improve their economy i don't i don't know that the ve[ry]- the act of being a state
sw2040B-ms98-a-0028 237.519000 248.888875 would would have any impact on on them uh i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now but of course if their economy is weak that there is not much of a base on which to tax
sw2040B-ms98-a-0029 248.888875 251.085000 i don't know if they suffer
sw2040B-ms98-a-0030 251.085000 252.903375 in a sense of
sw2040B-ms98-a-0031 252.903375 263.199500 income loss as being since they aren't a state whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be
sw2040B-ms98-a-0032 263.199500 265.197000 how do you feel though about
sw2040B-ms98-a-0033 265.197000 278.597125 well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory but uh i wonder how hav[ing]- having been in a territory but only as a young student and my parents were in the military at the time so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in the s[tates]- in the
sw2040B-ms98-a-0034 278.597125 281.908625 Alaska at the time since th[ey]- they voted absentee
sw2040B-ms98-a-0035 281.908625 286.975250 i i would imagine that it must be a little bit of a se[cond]- feeling of second class citizenry
sw2040B-ms98-a-0036 286.975250 294.686750 uh to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote the District of Columbia people for instance are quite frustrated i think at times
sw2040B-ms98-a-0037 294.686750 298.010375 in their not having a Senate representative
sw2040B-ms98-a-0038 298.010375 328.132000 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0039 328.132000 329.614500 um-hum

sw2040B-ms98-a-0041 331.459875 333.864000 uh i see what you mean so that
sw2040B-ms98-a-0042 333.864000 336.068375 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0043 336.068375 345.041625 yeah taxes would undoubtedly be occurring uh there i don't know i i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0044 345.041625 346.536875 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0045 346.536875 360.976375 frequently the laws in a territory are are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states i uh and i'm thinking in terms of education but then again each state sets its own and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like Puerto Rico
sw2040B-ms98-a-0046 360.976375 362.234375 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0047 362.234375 370.079125 um it's interesting because i hadn't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to uh economy 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0048 370.079125 371.435375 uh
sw2040B-ms98-a-0049 371.435375 374.744875 i had thought of it more in terms of political uh
sw2040B-ms98-a-0050 374.744875 382.373375 realization and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that gee anyone would rather be a state of the US than an independent country
sw2040B-ms98-a-0051 382.373375 383.606500 so
sw2040B-ms98-a-0052 383.606500 396.243250 [silence]

sw2040B-ms98-a-0058 420.390000 421.715000 that's interesting
sw2040B-ms98-a-0059 421.715000 423.671750 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0060 423.671750 428.129750 well it sounds as though you are in favor of uh status quo
sw2040B-ms98-a-0061 428.129750 431.498375 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0062 431.498375 444.468750 and i think uh having listened to you relative to the economy thing i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these so i'm ult[imately]- i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also
sw2040B-ms98-a-0063 444.468750 445.471000 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0064 445.471000 447.317375 at this point
sw2040B-ms98-a-0065 447.317375 449.814875 leaning towards uh statehood
sw2040B-ms98-a-0066 449.814875 461.365625 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0067 461.365625 476.130750 i think i would be troubled i suspect i believe that any of our states and i i constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions abou[t]- against that decision even if uh Louisiana chose to go with Creole or something
sw2040B-ms98-a-0068 476.130750 477.326250 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0069 477.326250 491.713750 i don't think there is any prohibitions i would be bothered by that i'm i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of America's strengths and that's the the the melting pot uh i i-
sw2040B-ms98-a-0070 491.713750 505.570750 am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to to the the past and i'm also realizing that that a common language i think is the ultimate bond of a country 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0071 505.570750 514.165125 and Canada i guess comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to French Quebec and whatever uh that i i think that would be
sw2040B-ms98-a-0072 514.165125 518.860000 a a negative step to make and i think that that they would need to reassess that
sw2040B-ms98-a-0073 518.860000 519.976250 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0074 519.976250 527.750000 i'm troubled even in by bilingualism uh in so far as that it intr[udes]- it gets in the way of of of the melting pot aspect 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0075 527.750000 554.542000 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0076 554.542000 555.777250 hum

sw2040B-ms98-a-0078 557.929375 559.032500 yeah
sw2040B-ms98-a-0079 559.032500 567.500625 but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn English and a second language
sw2040B-ms98-a-0080 567.500625 574.271500 but i'm [vocalized-noise] i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level 
sw2040B-ms98-a-0081 574.271500 575.812500 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0082 575.812500 577.019625 um
sw2040B-ms98-a-0083 577.019625 581.042125 i'm i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess
sw2040B-ms98-a-0084 581.042125 583.071375 [silence]
sw2040B-ms98-a-0085 583.071375 587.032625 well i think we have gone to time and i appreciate your having called
