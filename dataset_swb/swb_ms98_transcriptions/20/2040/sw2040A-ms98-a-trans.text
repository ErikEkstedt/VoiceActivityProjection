sw2040A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 1.515250 [noise]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0002 1.515250 11.378875 yes um i was wondering whether you were in favor of statehood independence or the status quo for Puerto Rico
sw2040A-ms98-a-0003 11.378875 54.593375 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0004 54.593375 57.683250 well i'm i guess
sw2040A-ms98-a-0005 57.683250 65.081875 i don't have su[ch]- such close experience with with um an area becoming a state as you do
sw2040A-ms98-a-0006 65.081875 78.004125 um my concern is the economy because as i understand it Puerto Rico has a very low st[andard]- uh standard of living or at least um annual average income
sw2040A-ms98-a-0007 78.004125 89.611750 um part of this i suppose is justified in i[n]- in that the climate they don't need perhaps the heating and the housing that some of th[e]- the more northern territories need
sw2040A-ms98-a-0008 89.611750 94.837000 however in that case i guess i would favor status quo
sw2040A-ms98-a-0009 94.837000 100.660500 i have been to Puerto Rico and and found it very very interesting i did Peace Corps training there
sw2040A-ms98-a-0010 100.660500 113.374125 and so um you know i saw it also as a young student and and it was very foreign in a certain sense although i had grown up in California and so the Spanish was no problem
sw2040A-ms98-a-0011 113.374125 115.697625 um it was
sw2040A-ms98-a-0012 115.697625 124.477625 it was you know very lovely and and the people seemed very friendly and and nice i have actually i work with uh
sw2040A-ms98-a-0013 124.477625 130.733625 a girl from Puerto Rico and i guess i have never thought to ask her which she favors
sw2040A-ms98-a-0014 130.733625 132.221750 uh
sw2040A-ms98-a-0015 132.221750 142.573500 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0016 142.573500 146.323500 well probably more on in terms of the US
sw2040A-ms98-a-0017 146.323500 147.909375 um
sw2040A-ms98-a-0018 147.909375 152.053500 you know i'm i'm not quite sure how the US copes
sw2040A-ms98-a-0019 152.053500 156.442750 with this sort of thing i've lived [abrode/abroad] abroad most of my life so 
sw2040A-ms98-a-0020 156.442750 163.913250 i guess i i've been very cut off uh i lived actually in Lebanon so i was very cut off from the
sw2040A-ms98-a-0021 163.913250 166.398625 the press as i w[as]- you know
sw2040A-ms98-a-0022 166.398625 172.681875 and uh bec[oming]- was becoming an adult so i don't know how the US would cope with it a
sw2040A-ms98-a-0023 172.681875 177.051000 new state that is so very very poor
sw2040A-ms98-a-0024 177.051000 183.882625 um i guess you know we'd have a lot of aid if if you consider the inner cities of
sw2040A-ms98-a-0025 183.882625 194.221875 like New York and and how much aid it needs i suppose the whole country or the whole um new state would require such aid
sw2040A-ms98-a-0026 194.221875 203.989750 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0027 203.989750 205.842750 i think so
sw2040A-ms98-a-0028 205.842750 222.480750 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0029 222.480750 224.120250 um-hum
sw2040A-ms98-a-0030 224.120250 299.540250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0031 299.540250 304.796500 um-hum yeah th[ose]- those are good points um which obviously [laughter-i'd] never thought about
sw2040A-ms98-a-0032 304.796500 306.170625 um
sw2040A-ms98-a-0033 306.170625 309.995875 i don't know wh[at]- uh i suppose
sw2040A-ms98-a-0034 309.995875 313.441250 they also not being a state are
sw2040A-ms98-a-0035 313.441250 317.186500 probably freer to determine their own
sw2040A-ms98-a-0036 317.186500 321.609750 um ways of life than they would if if
sw2040A-ms98-a-0037 321.609750 328.737625 i- i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory
sw2040A-ms98-a-0038 328.737625 331.514750 perhaps compulsory education
sw2040A-ms98-a-0039 331.514750 333.151250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0040 333.151250 334.582625 um
sw2040A-ms98-a-0041 334.582625 337.103125 and taxes [laughter]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0042 337.103125 381.357500 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0043 381.357500 390.065750 um-hum w[ell]- well actually i thin[k]- one one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that
sw2040A-ms98-a-0044 390.065750 396.939375 they've recently voted that Spanish is the official language which i always assumed it was anyway
sw2040A-ms98-a-0045 396.939375 400.320625 so if they've just taken such action
sw2040A-ms98-a-0046 400.320625 407.986750 it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want
sw2040A-ms98-a-0047 407.986750 411.423750 to declare this before they become a state
sw2040A-ms98-a-0048 411.423750 419.981750 or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the Spanish or Hispanic heritage
sw2040A-ms98-a-0049 419.981750 427.745250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0050 427.745250 431.775625 i i believe i would probably tend towards that
sw2040A-ms98-a-0051 431.775625 444.943750 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0052 444.943750 446.791250 well that's interesting
sw2040A-ms98-a-0053 446.791250 450.045250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0054 450.045250 457.522875 right what about if if um they demanded to have Spanish as the official language
sw2040A-ms98-a-0055 457.522875 460.250000 as a condition for statehood
sw2040A-ms98-a-0056 460.250000 488.920250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0057 488.920250 490.269250 um-hum
sw2040A-ms98-a-0058 490.269250 505.225375 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0059 505.225375 506.608750 um
sw2040A-ms98-a-0060 506.608750 526.949250 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0061 526.949250 528.795375 um-hum um-hum
sw2040A-ms98-a-0062 528.795375 529.956625 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0063 529.956625 531.975500 that's interesting because
sw2040A-ms98-a-0064 531.975500 536.690000 although i tend to be bilingual Spanish based on experience
sw2040A-ms98-a-0065 536.690000 538.481250 uh
sw2040A-ms98-a-0066 538.481250 543.372375 i was in bilingual education in California and
sw2040A-ms98-a-0067 543.372375 546.533875 i didn't have any problem with my students but i noticed my
sw2040A-ms98-a-0068 546.533875 550.520250 my brother wh[o]- who was uh quite a bit younger
sw2040A-ms98-a-0069 550.520250 555.131000 was learning Spanish in elementary school and he can't speak a word
sw2040A-ms98-a-0070 555.131000 558.961625 and so obviously it didn't work in California
sw2040A-ms98-a-0071 558.961625 560.943750 [silence]
sw2040A-ms98-a-0072 560.943750 562.309125 right

sw2040A-ms98-a-0076 573.317750 575.314250 oh i see
