sw2013B-ms98-a-0003 2.176625 3.291125 good and yourself

sw2013B-ms98-a-0005 6.189625 8.062875 yeah me too
sw2013B-ms98-a-0006 8.062875 9.793750 pardon me
sw2013B-ms98-a-0007 9.793750 11.200125 i'm in Lewisville
sw2013B-ms98-a-0008 11.200125 21.296250 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0009 21.296250 22.682125 little bit
sw2013B-ms98-a-0010 22.682125 26.376625 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0011 26.376625 37.968750 that's a hard issue to decide uh on the one hand you don't want to have to take away but on the other hand you don't want uh the poorer school districts to go under either and uh here in Lewisville they had a thing on the ballot that they wanted to
sw2013B-ms98-a-0012 37.968750 43.211375 uh rollback the taxes on everybody's houses and everybody would save
sw2013B-ms98-a-0013 43.211375 54.067875 uh twenty dollars a year or whatever but it would cut back twenty million dollars in to the schools and i happened to know a good teacher here in the school district and she was really against it because that would just take away all all their money
sw2013B-ms98-a-0014 54.067875 61.690750 and as far as i'm concerned you know hey twenty bucks a year is not too much to me and they could raise a few more dollars and get better uh things for the schools that's what we need because_1 we got
sw2013B-ms98-a-0015 61.690750 68.110875 you know Texas is known for it's poor schools and that's too bad because_1 we got little kids and we're uh not too pleased about that
sw2013B-ms98-a-0016 68.110875 70.484625 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0017 70.484625 71.905750 pardon me
sw2013B-ms98-a-0018 71.905750 73.349625 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0019 73.349625 74.743250 that's true
sw2013B-ms98-a-0020 74.743250 78.760250 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0021 78.760250 81.784875 yeah i know that's that's only part of the problem
sw2013B-ms98-a-0022 81.784875 83.647750 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0023 83.647750 85.282625 i think we're gonna s[ee]-
sw2013B-ms98-a-0024 85.282625 86.328000 are you
sw2013B-ms98-a-0025 86.328000 87.807000 okay
sw2013B-ms98-a-0026 87.807000 90.213625 i think were gonna see a day come
sw2013B-ms98-a-0027 90.213625 92.147250 yeah
sw2013B-ms98-a-0028 92.147250 103.086250 i think i think we're gonna see a day when s[chools]- uh grade schools are gonna be charging tuition just like colleges are uh and it'll only be to those who are having kids going to school that's probably the most fair way but
sw2013B-ms98-a-0029 103.086250 108.539500 you know uh that way old people don't have to have have money going to the schools because_1 they don't have little kids going to schools
sw2013B-ms98-a-0030 108.539500 116.657250 but uh i wouldn't be surprised if that happens within the next few years uh that sort of thing happening and uh we'll see what happens
sw2013B-ms98-a-0031 116.657250 119.469250 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0032 119.469250 120.778250 yeah
sw2013B-ms98-a-0033 120.778250 122.089750 yes
sw2013B-ms98-a-0034 122.089750 123.609625 um
sw2013B-ms98-a-0035 123.609625 126.326375 i don't know that i think has
sw2013B-ms98-a-0036 126.326375 129.690250 pluses and minuses because_1 uh those that
sw2013B-ms98-a-0037 129.690250 137.648875 are economically disadvantaged won't have the ability to make a [laughter-choice] the choice will be thrust upon them and so where's the freedom of choice no freedom of choice in that case and that's
sw2013B-ms98-a-0038 137.648875 153.185000 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0039 153.185000 154.937625 yes
sw2013B-ms98-a-0040 154.937625 156.391875 yes
sw2013B-ms98-a-0041 156.391875 157.716125 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0042 157.716125 169.443750 i think the only way they're gonna really get to the problem and solve it is to have equal funding for every school in the state whether you it's in a poor tax district or a high tax district and uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0043 169.443750 179.596750 that's the only way that i can see it's gonna be resolved is there are gonna be people in the rich district that are gonna fight that and and it's gonna be a real bad mess because there's people on every side of the problem
sw2013B-ms98-a-0044 179.596750 182.278375 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0045 182.278375 183.554375 yeah
sw2013B-ms98-a-0046 183.554375 195.303250 and they should give every teacher a a hundred percent raise [laughter] tha[t]- [vocalized-noise] that's the problem is the teachers don't get enough money and anybody who could be a good teacher doesn't want to become a teacher usually because they don't pay enough
sw2013B-ms98-a-0047 195.303250 209.473750 i mean when i was in college i did a lot of teaching uh for my degree and uh i got a lot of good out of that and i liked teaching but i really couldn't go into teaching because_1 it was not economically feasible for me to do so
sw2013B-ms98-a-0048 209.473750 211.535250 i'm a mathematician
sw2013B-ms98-a-0049 211.535250 213.342375 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0050 213.342375 214.868625 pardon me
sw2013B-ms98-a-0051 214.868625 218.260375 [laughter-oh] i don't know there are better fields to pick
sw2013B-ms98-a-0052 218.260375 220.313875 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0053 220.313875 221.859500 i mean
sw2013B-ms98-a-0054 221.859500 227.940875 yeah where i you know kind of stuff i do i i use my education quite a bit but where i was before i wasn't using it hardly at all
sw2013B-ms98-a-0055 227.940875 237.648500 so it all depends i mean it depends on where you wind up i guess but i really enjoyed teaching it you know i but wouldn't mind getting back into it someday but who knows what'll happen in the future
sw2013B-ms98-a-0056 237.648500 242.045000 the way people are being laid off right and left it's all a matter of uh what happens next
sw2013B-ms98-a-0057 242.045000 250.021250 but uh ba[ck]- back to the taxes though i mean uh it's a difficult issue no one wants their taxes raised but on the other hand you got to do something
sw2013B-ms98-a-0058 250.021250 251.984750 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0059 251.984750 261.551250 i can see that there might be a reason for one but i would hate to do that because_1 uh that would be very difficult for my family financially to to afford a state income tax
sw2013B-ms98-a-0060 261.551250 263.050000 and
sw2013B-ms98-a-0061 263.050000 267.320500 most states have it i know and i've lived in states that have had it but
sw2013B-ms98-a-0062 267.320500 277.500750 way uh way financing is now if we had a state income tax i'd uh have a very hard time financing my house again you know paying off my mortgage each month that's so that's a problem
sw2013B-ms98-a-0063 277.500750 278.854125 um
sw2013B-ms98-a-0064 278.854125 285.949000 which just matter of we'll see what happens i'd rather have that i guess than have a s[tate]- state lottery because_1 when you bring
sw2013B-ms98-a-0065 285.949000 287.712750 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0066 287.712750 289.137250 no it didn't
sw2013B-ms98-a-0067 289.137250 294.766125 which means there's a higher probability of now having a state income tax even though good old tax and spend Annie my favorite
sw2013B-ms98-a-0068 294.766125 304.529875 uh decided that uh during the campaign she said we weren't gonna have a state income tax and now she's gonna renege on that which i expected her to do anyway uh we'll see what happens i don't know
sw2013B-ms98-a-0069 304.529875 306.749750 at any rate uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0070 306.749750 311.436125 that [vocalized-noise] 
sw2013B-ms98-a-0071 311.436125 314.065625 actually no um
sw2013B-ms98-a-0072 314.065625 323.978625 i'm surprised that m[y]- uh my income taxes are as low as they are uh we just finished our income taxes and we're getting a nice little refund back this year which is which is nicer than having to pay out 
sw2013B-ms98-a-0073 323.978625 326.231500 uh which is a matter of uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0074 326.231500 329.103250 um i'm surprised it's
sw2013B-ms98-a-0075 329.103250 334.412750 well considering the national budget i think George Bush wanted one point four trillion dollars
sw2013B-ms98-a-0076 334.412750 344.427500 for the national budget and for a family of four like what i got that comes out to over twenty two thousand dollars that we it it's our share to pay in but i'm not paying that much income tax
sw2013B-ms98-a-0077 344.427500 355.170500 and you're gonna think well wait now [noise] where's the other eighteen thousand dollars or whatever coming in wh[ere]- how how is that coming from me i guess it comes from companies and businesses and whatnot but
sw2013B-ms98-a-0078 355.170500 359.271125 it's interesting i don't know i can't imagine i guess that's why we're going in debt so deeply
sw2013B-ms98-a-0079 359.271125 365.752625 they bring in half a trillion dollars and they spend one point four and then the rest goes to to the national debt
sw2013B-ms98-a-0080 365.752625 377.592000 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0081 377.592000 379.436250 that's about it i guess
sw2013B-ms98-a-0082 379.436250 385.515375 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0083 385.515375 386.716250 yeah

sw2013B-ms98-a-0085 388.265125 389.881375 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0086 389.881375 397.560750 seven percent or something it depends on where you're at some places in Dallas i guess it's like closer to eight and places like in Lewisville it's a lot closer to seven
sw2013B-ms98-a-0087 397.560750 398.996625 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0088 398.996625 399.810625 hum-um

sw2013B-ms98-a-0090 401.653500 402.920750 how's that
sw2013B-ms98-a-0091 402.920750 407.713125 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0092 407.713125 409.181875 oh yes
sw2013B-ms98-a-0093 409.181875 410.824500 that's the way to do it
sw2013B-ms98-a-0094 410.824500 424.155750 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0095 424.155750 425.519875 no

sw2013B-ms98-a-0098 429.835875 435.013250 and so when you start taking talking taking more out of your paycheck to go to the state income tax
sw2013B-ms98-a-0099 435.013250 436.438250 uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0100 436.438250 439.138625 [silence]
sw2013B-ms98-a-0101 439.138625 445.735625 yeah i think what we n[eed]- what uh the government the state government needs to do is get in there and cut spending
sw2013B-ms98-a-0102 445.735625 455.289125 because_1 when they got all this fraud and waste going on they need to just get in there and and get out the garbage that's in there right now i mean i once heard that uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0103 455.289125 459.537375 uh for the for the federal government at least that if they uh
sw2013B-ms98-a-0104 459.537375 469.819750 uh well for like on the welfare system if they gave all that money directly to the people every welfare recipient would be making like forty five thousand dollars a year
sw2013B-ms98-a-0105 469.819750 481.990875 and you know they're not making that much money they're making probably more like five or six on the welfare so where's the other ninety percent going well it's going to the some fat guy in the middle who's sitting there on his behind all day doing nothing but filling out papers
sw2013B-ms98-a-0106 481.990875 485.251250 lots of people yeah yeah
