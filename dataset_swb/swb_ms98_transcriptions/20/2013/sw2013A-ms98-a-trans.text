sw2013A-ms98-a-0045 310.878750 312.622500 [silence]
sw2013A-ms98-a-0046 312.622500 314.578500 no

sw2013A-ms98-a-0051 366.326500 376.922125 which just keeps accumulating [noise] i don't know [noise] what else do you think about them_1 let's see the state
sw2013A-ms98-a-0052 376.922125 379.777500 [silence]
sw2013A-ms98-a-0053 379.777500 390.270750 and the city tax the sale tax they used to you really didn't even think anything about it when you bought something but now you do [laughter] it figures in what is it seven point
sw2013A-ms98-a-0054 390.270750 397.112250 [silence]
sw2013A-ms98-a-0055 397.112250 401.365125 i don't even know how they figure it really i'm glad i don't work in a store
sw2013A-ms98-a-0056 401.365125 402.790750 [silence]
sw2013A-ms98-a-0057 402.790750 408.533625 because_1 i wouldn't want to have to figure this seven point something percent i guess they've got a little table though and it's all written out
sw2013A-ms98-a-0058 408.533625 413.635125 so it wouldn't be so bad [noise] all right so you think
sw2013A-ms98-a-0059 413.635125 416.680375 federal tax is okay
sw2013A-ms98-a-0060 416.680375 420.595250 state tax you can see the logic of it but
sw2013A-ms98-a-0061 420.595250 429.611750 you don't think it would be economically feasible for your family and ours see both of us are teachers and we got four in our family too
sw2013A-ms98-a-0062 429.611750 431.956375 we don't need anymore
