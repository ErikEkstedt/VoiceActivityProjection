sw2082B-ms98-a-0007 33.309000 45.606625 but we have so much traffic now so many cars you know they're trying to fix it uh with all this emission control and everything but then i still see cars going down the road with all this smoke pouring out of the back end of them_1
sw2082B-ms98-a-0008 45.606625 56.668500 and that infuriates me i always want to tell them you know don't you know what you're doing to our air and i don't understand how they can get their uh how they can get their car inspected and get away with that

sw2082B-ms98-a-0014 86.943750 97.063750 and he went to get his inspected and there was something about the emissions something that wasn't quite right and they wouldn't pass it and mean there's no smoke or anything comes out of his car it's a nice car
sw2082B-ms98-a-0015 97.063750 104.084250 and uh he had to have a lot of work done on it before it would meet you know the emissions and he went to several places
sw2082B-ms98-a-0016 104.084250 108.202375 so so they're starting to crack down
sw2082B-ms98-a-0017 108.202375 110.716250 yeah i i really
sw2082B-ms98-a-0018 110.716250 122.629875 [silence]
