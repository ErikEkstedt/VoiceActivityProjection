sw2027A-ms98-a-0006 53.967000 66.556250 you know boxes of documents around so if i'm just gonna be there working in the litigation center and doing you know odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents i dress down but if we're going to have a meeting

sw2027A-ms98-a-0014 106.182250 115.610250 a matter of fact i thought i had one funny story when um i was at TI the first year or so we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through
sw2027A-ms98-a-0015 115.610250 124.094625 two thousand boxes we had them in the warehouse and at that point it the warehouse was over across the road and it wasn't air conditioned
sw2027A-ms98-a-0016 124.094625 130.322500 and if we were there like in the middle of the summer it's unair-conditioned it was dusty and dirty
sw2027A-ms98-a-0017 130.322500 144.589875 um there was like a fan at the very end of the row and that was it and so we didn't really know we weren't supposed to we thought TI dress code was just dress appropriate to your job we wore shorts we didn't know that was a big no no
sw2027A-ms98-a-0018 144.589875 158.600000 and a supervisor from another area came up to us and you know this area where record retention is there's only a few people that work there and he sh[ould]- he knew who worked there he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there
sw2027A-ms98-a-0019 158.600000 170.727250 and he came up to us and he just said who's your supervisor well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor and it went up all the way to the head of facilities complaining that we were wearing shorts
sw2027A-ms98-a-0020 170.727250 180.681500 he didn't at least say to us did you know you're not supposed to do that that could have alleviated a big [laughter-problem] we ended up getting called out on it [laughter]

sw2027A-ms98-a-0058 369.563625 374.733250 well the uh the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because
sw2027A-ms98-a-0059 374.733250 388.093125 we had uh another person coming from Washington our outside counsel and she was told that we were gonna be in a warehouse but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse but the warehouse
sw2027A-ms98-a-0060 388.093125 392.400125 and she came with skirts just like she'd be going into the office
sw2027A-ms98-a-0061 392.400125 398.482125 and we'd [laughter-try] we'd try to say didn't you bring any pants or anything we're we're out here in the warehouse
sw2027A-ms98-a-0062 398.482125 408.594875 you know you you got your skid of you know that wooden pallet of boxes and you're gonna have to un[load]- unload your skids look at the documents in the in the boxes and then repack your skid
sw2027A-ms98-a-0063 408.594875 411.770000 and [laughter-she]
sw2027A-ms98-a-0064 411.770000 423.745375 and she was so she was so hot and miserable you know in the skirt she finally tried to go buy you know a pair of pants but you know i mean it was just completely miserable for her

sw2027A-ms98-a-0069 463.470000 477.386750 some of our people in the legal department we have um assistants to the general counsel and it's funny because there's one that always wears a suit a matter of fact he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on buttoned
sw2027A-ms98-a-0070 477.386750 487.346000 and then there's another one who's who's a little younger and a little more {yuppyish} and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and you know a shirt and sometimes he wears the jacket to it
sw2027A-ms98-a-0071 487.346000 498.172000 and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt so that's just [laughter-you]
sw2027A-ms98-a-0072 498.172000 503.477500 [laughter] you know with the you know the little suspenders or something on so [laughter-we]
sw2027A-ms98-a-0073 503.477500 515.694500 we've kind of had a variety there but i think a lot of times it's it's mainly who they're going to meet with they're they're meeting with people that they know is gonna be dressed that way then that's how they are if there just gonna be meeting with TIers
sw2027A-ms98-a-0074 515.694500 523.983750 like to talk about a patent kind of thing and the they're engineers that they're talking too they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed and they're usually casual
sw2027A-ms98-a-0075 523.983750 526.233625 [silence]

sw2027A-ms98-a-0079 551.735375 565.483875 yeah this is this is kind of a fun project i've done i've done some of the other speech programs but we've never got to talk to another person it was always just talking to the computer so this is a little different
sw2027A-ms98-a-0080 565.483875 570.719750 yeah okay bye [noise]
