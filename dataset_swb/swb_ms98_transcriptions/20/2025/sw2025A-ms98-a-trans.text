sw2025A-ms98-a-0004 20.062500 20.360500 [noise]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0005 20.360500 22.879625 hangings on weekends
sw2025A-ms98-a-0006 22.879625 24.021125 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0007 24.021125 27.723250 in public places there is one state that does that by the way
sw2025A-ms98-a-0008 27.723250 31.183250 i want to say Oklahoma i saw re[port]- something the other night about it
sw2025A-ms98-a-0009 31.183250 34.696750 they don't do them_1 real often [vocalized-noise] which is obviously the death penalty 
sw2025A-ms98-a-0010 34.696750 40.297375 um but i think if we quit uh building these Taj Mahals with the color TVs
sw2025A-ms98-a-0011 40.297375 51.484000 and sixty doll[ars]- sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them_1 and get it over with and let's just quit screwing up the system uh 
sw2025A-ms98-a-0012 51.484000 59.255250 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0013 59.255250 60.943875 that's pathetic

sw2025A-ms98-a-0016 64.802000 82.546000 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0017 82.546000 88.396875 this is true a[nd]- a[nd]- a[nd]- and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to
sw2025A-ms98-a-0018 88.396875 98.643000 life in prison then he's available for parole if it's if it's life and a day then he's not eligible for parole so what you know let's quit BSing with the system

sw2025A-ms98-a-0026 130.327500 132.131375 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0027 132.131375 140.450000 just shouldn't be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge [noise]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0028 140.450000 146.613500 [noise] the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene
sw2025A-ms98-a-0029 146.613500 156.598125 uh when there's uh my understanding when there's uh a verdict and it for example there's a hung jury here in Fort Worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off
sw2025A-ms98-a-0030 156.598125 161.094500 uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay
sw2025A-ms98-a-0031 161.094500 173.506875 um kind of gets back to the second request we've been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an [ananimous/unanimous] verdict the a situation like that i'd say no let's just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight
sw2025A-ms98-a-0032 173.506875 179.410125 there's a per[centage]- certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey
sw2025A-ms98-a-0033 179.410125 181.444125 the guy's guilty
sw2025A-ms98-a-0034 181.444125 190.514500 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0035 190.514500 191.985000 exactly
sw2025A-ms98-a-0036 191.985000 197.772125 [silence]
sw2025A-ms98-a-0037 197.772125 205.057125 exactly because it's not next day they have the start the trial whi[ch]- is X number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more
sw2025A-ms98-a-0038 205.057125 211.406000 i think that that if it's an if it's not a split decision uh go with the highest number and let's just get on with the program 
sw2025A-ms98-a-0039 211.406000 222.483375 uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since there's a jury because_1 that's what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings
sw2025A-ms98-a-0040 222.483375 282.647625 [silence]

sw2025A-ms98-a-0045 299.537125 312.016500 yeah yeah i mean you're you're in Dallas so everybody i can't believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who don't know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence you'd have to be pretty dense
sw2025A-ms98-a-0046 312.016500 317.104875 you'd be in have to be in a cave not to know what's going on or moving it to Lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer
