sw2025B-ms98-a-0012 25.933125 26.940875 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0013 26.940875 28.743125 really what is that
sw2025B-ms98-a-0014 28.743125 30.649250 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0015 30.649250 32.308000 hm
sw2025B-ms98-a-0016 32.308000 33.966125 yeah
sw2025B-ms98-a-0017 33.966125 35.631000 yeah
sw2025B-ms98-a-0018 35.631000 49.481625 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0019 49.481625 63.520125 yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before he's paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months
sw2025B-ms98-a-0020 63.520125 68.780375 because they just say there's either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or [noise]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0021 68.780375 83.078750 you know it's just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what he's going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know what's his whim to decide it should be two months
sw2025B-ms98-a-0022 83.078750 85.515500 you know it's crazy
sw2025B-ms98-a-0023 85.515500 94.860500 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0024 94.860500 96.291250 yeah
sw2025B-ms98-a-0025 96.291250 97.830750 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0026 97.830750 110.512750 well even if it's life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for s[tarving]- children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that
sw2025B-ms98-a-0027 110.512750 117.008250 so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really
sw2025B-ms98-a-0028 117.008250 128.046125 i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and it's not just like you know one instance or something it's just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on 
sw2025B-ms98-a-0029 128.046125 133.421625 yeah and the yeah there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um
sw2025B-ms98-a-0030 133.421625 135.268375 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0031 135.268375 136.733875 yeah

sw2025B-ms98-a-0035 159.059250 162.279875 right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah
sw2025B-ms98-a-0036 162.279875 178.467000 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0037 178.467000 191.361875 right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a f[ortune]- you know a fortune to keep doing that
sw2025B-ms98-a-0038 191.361875 198.415750 and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution
sw2025B-ms98-a-0039 198.415750 202.040000 [silence]
sw2025B-ms98-a-0040 202.040000 203.486500 right

sw2025B-ms98-a-0045 219.379125 221.884875 yeah yeah
sw2025B-ms98-a-0046 221.884875 234.301250 well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from Florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really
sw2025B-ms98-a-0047 234.301250 242.190250 you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side
sw2025B-ms98-a-0048 242.190250 253.896125 and have some judge that was paid off or you know had goo[d]- a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power
sw2025B-ms98-a-0049 253.896125 265.025625 you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i don't know if it prevents it but [noise] seems like the jury system does have it's advantages
sw2025B-ms98-a-0050 265.025625 274.798625 but i also i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know
sw2025B-ms98-a-0051 274.798625 282.892250 and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers at that point they're really getting a select group it's not just random people
sw2025B-ms98-a-0052 282.892250 288.366125 it almost should be the first twelve people that they [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-that] [laughter-have] [laughter-on] [laughter-a] [laughter-list] are the ones that are on the jury and that's it
sw2025B-ms98-a-0053 288.366125 289.521500 you know
sw2025B-ms98-a-0054 289.521500 293.972000 [silence]
