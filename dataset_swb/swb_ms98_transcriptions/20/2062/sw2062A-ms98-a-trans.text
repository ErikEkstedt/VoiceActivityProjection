sw2062A-ms98-a-0002 0.286250 1.312750 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0003 1.312750 5.948500 well what d[o]- do you think in terms of uh benefits
sw2062A-ms98-a-0004 5.948500 33.013750 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0005 33.013750 34.801750 absolutely
sw2062A-ms98-a-0006 34.801750 40.720625 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0007 40.720625 54.141500 well i have to agree with that you know i was thinking about um importance of benefits and that kind of thing other than salary while i was waiting for uh the system to find a a respondent
sw2062A-ms98-a-0008 54.141500 62.493500 and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone
sw2062A-ms98-a-0009 62.493500 66.891500 when i was much younger it was uh
sw2062A-ms98-a-0010 66.891500 81.677000 less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits but as i grow older and my family grows it the medical benefits are more important and the retirement is more important
sw2062A-ms98-a-0011 81.677000 125.007250 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0012 125.007250 126.937250 i think they have um
sw2062A-ms98-a-0013 126.937250 136.981875 a one that we need to recognize that we're going to have to supplement ourselves and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the
sw2062A-ms98-a-0014 136.981875 140.462875 uh CODA Plan it's
sw2062A-ms98-a-0015 140.462875 152.339250 certainly a a supplemental way uh and i suppose if b[ut]- maybe in in your instance if if you're started with TI in your
sw2062A-ms98-a-0016 152.339250 158.883625 early to mid twenties and happen to stay with them_1 until you're sixty five then you'll have a very good retirement plan
sw2062A-ms98-a-0017 158.883625 160.380000 but i
sw2062A-ms98-a-0018 160.380000 165.429125 had another career first and then came to TI a little later
sw2062A-ms98-a-0019 165.429125 171.639500 so it's not uh all by itself it won't be adequate for for my situation
sw2062A-ms98-a-0020 171.639500 174.810000 so i have to find a way to supplement that
sw2062A-ms98-a-0021 174.810000 199.273125 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0022 199.273125 208.753750 i unders[tand]- understand though it uh believe me i do that myself and i disagree with you i don't think it's the worst investment in the world
sw2062A-ms98-a-0023 208.753750 213.025875 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0024 213.025875 223.137000 well it's in terms of guaranteed return on investment and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed until later
sw2062A-ms98-a-0025 223.137000 229.589375 uh it's shown a history that uh sure beats anything else
sw2062A-ms98-a-0026 229.589375 230.777000 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0027 230.777000 233.210125 over many many years
sw2062A-ms98-a-0028 233.210125 304.467375 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0029 304.467375 310.903125 i understand that approach that's what that's exactly what's happening in my family [vocalized-noise]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0030 310.903125 316.408875 except that mine are a little bit older and and i've shown them_1 the numbers and said
sw2062A-ms98-a-0031 316.408875 325.840500 this is what's going to be available all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there you better make sure that you've got a scholarship
sw2062A-ms98-a-0032 325.840500 327.108875 [laughter]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0033 327.108875 359.771750 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0034 359.771750 364.832000 i know and boy it gets really scary when you start talking to them_1 um
sw2062A-ms98-a-0035 364.832000 378.286750 i have a an eleven year old daughter now who's saying gee dad i want to be an allergist and i said that's wonderful i applaud that let me explain to you how you get scholarships to do that
sw2062A-ms98-a-0036 378.286750 391.241000 and then her little brother's only two years behind and he says well i don't know i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian and i said that's great let me explain to you how you get [laughter-scholarships] to do that
sw2062A-ms98-a-0037 391.241000 392.179875 [laughter]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0038 392.179875 426.003000 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0039 426.003000 430.935750 well that's fantastic and on whole o[n]- i would say that they're
sw2062A-ms98-a-0040 430.935750 432.501250 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0041 432.501250 437.242125 equal to uh most of our competitors
sw2062A-ms98-a-0042 437.242125 443.141625 uh i can see some some potential changes that
sw2062A-ms98-a-0043 443.141625 447.095750 probably are are would not cost very much but
sw2062A-ms98-a-0044 447.095750 454.010125 might uh make things a little easier such as offering a a smorgasbord
sw2062A-ms98-a-0045 454.010125 465.170000 having a larger variety of benefits but here's the amount that that TI is going to pay for it now it's up to you it's menu selection so to speak
sw2062A-ms98-a-0046 465.170000 515.134000 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0047 515.134000 525.356375 well i could certainly personally stand seeing them go to a a standardized compensatory time for overtime
sw2062A-ms98-a-0048 525.356375 530.581875 and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days if they did that
sw2062A-ms98-a-0049 530.581875 532.199750 uh
sw2062A-ms98-a-0050 532.199750 540.732375 and and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one or or you know maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one
sw2062A-ms98-a-0051 540.732375 542.148500 uh
sw2062A-ms98-a-0052 542.148500 551.104625 a[s]- as a repayment for every three to five days that i work overtime there they should give me one day
sw2062A-ms98-a-0053 551.104625 562.701500 but it should be a standard and and not left up to either the whim or the current overhead rate th[at's]- uh that's running in each department
sw2062A-ms98-a-0054 562.701500 586.712625 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0055 586.712625 588.449000 well that's for sure
sw2062A-ms98-a-0056 588.449000 592.468750 [silence]
sw2062A-ms98-a-0057 592.468750 599.455500 oh i'm sure personalities always come into play uh just in this size of organization
