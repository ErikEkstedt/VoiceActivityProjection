sw2062B-ms98-a-0002 4.080375 16.226000 well personally you know i think you know of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package and i think that uh we've probably got one of the best around you know besides
sw2062B-ms98-a-0003 16.226000 22.636500 yeah they tend to offer ad[equate]- adequate vacation i guess and the paid time off is wonderful and uh 
sw2062B-ms98-a-0004 22.636500 33.817250 [vocalized-noise] one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the CODA Plan that is offered and i think that is just a a fabulous one so i don't know if you participate in that or not but 
sw2062B-ms98-a-0005 33.817250 35.756750 isn't it great [laughter]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0006 35.756750 40.575000 it's just a it's just a miracle that how fast that adds up you know
sw2062B-ms98-a-0007 40.575000 48.285500 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0008 48.285500 49.530125 uh-huh

sw2062B-ms98-a-0014 82.069625 95.327000 i had never really thought of it that way but i guess that's true i guess that's true i'm still young enough that that uh the vacation's real important to me and the paid time off is real important to me and and that kind of thing but uh
sw2062B-ms98-a-0015 95.327000 101.552000 you know i was just as a matter of fact i just uh celebrated my fifth year at TI the end of last month and uh
sw2062B-ms98-a-0016 101.552000 112.217750 kind of started looking through the the book because of that you know now that i'm a hundred percent vested you know you kind of look through the book and see well what exactly what does that mean and what is the pension all about and
sw2062B-ms98-a-0017 112.217750 121.596875 you know when you're when you're you know in your i'm only in my late twenties now so you tend not to think about retirement but uh it's i guess now is the time to think about it so
sw2062B-ms98-a-0018 121.596875 125.106125 [noise] does TI have a pretty good retirement package do you think
sw2062B-ms98-a-0019 125.106125 131.073750 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0020 131.073750 132.599000 yeah

sw2062B-ms98-a-0029 172.174750 174.073875 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0030 174.073875 182.290750 yeah well they just they seem to make it so easy to save you know one of the things that we're doing which is probably
sw2062B-ms98-a-0031 182.290750 192.771375 the worst investment in the world but i've got money coming out [vocalized-noise] to buy savings bonds just coming straight out of my check and it's probably not a great investment but if i wasn't doing that
sw2062B-ms98-a-0032 192.771375 200.623375 the money wouldn't be being saved anyway you know y[ou]- i kind of have to trade off you know if you never see it you don't spend it so [laughter] and it's 
sw2062B-ms98-a-0033 200.623375 201.959875 yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0034 201.959875 203.576750 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0035 203.576750 205.406750 do you yeah

sw2062B-ms98-a-0037 207.258500 213.415875 do you really not i- i [vocalized-noise] you know i- i debate about whether it's really good or not you know
sw2062B-ms98-a-0038 213.415875 221.364125 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0039 221.364125 222.745750 yeah

sw2062B-ms98-a-0041 224.157375 228.707625 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0042 228.707625 232.321250 yeah that's true that's very true
sw2062B-ms98-a-0043 232.321250 240.378375 we went uh and did a a thing through IBS which is a like a financial consultant type thing here in in Dallas 
sw2062B-ms98-a-0044 240.378375 251.206125 and uh one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was you know they work up this whole big you know proposal profile for you that ev[ery]- all the things that you need to work on and you need to do
sw2062B-ms98-a-0045 251.206125 263.975375 and then one of the things that we talked about with her was you know the need to save for our son's education we have a two year old you know and and you know we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen you know we have to do that now and and uh
sw2062B-ms98-a-0046 263.975375 275.066875 [noise] they have a way that they can figure you know what you know and he's two now in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college this is how much it'll cost you know and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to it's
sw2062B-ms98-a-0047 275.066875 279.139125 [noise] what it costs now is ridiculous what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just
sw2062B-ms98-a-0048 279.139125 290.526250 really scary and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like fif[teen]- between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a oh you know six percent interest rate to be able to have
sw2062B-ms98-a-0049 290.526250 304.957625 you know money for his college and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds is is you know about fifteen hundred dollars a year so i guess it you know in that way at least we know that that's taken care of you know we we can worry about other things so
sw2062B-ms98-a-0050 304.957625 307.480250 yeah yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0051 307.480250 308.928000 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0052 308.928000 311.014500 is it really yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0053 311.014500 321.353125 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0054 321.353125 322.813250 uh-huh
sw2062B-ms98-a-0055 322.813250 324.808250 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0056 324.808250 333.902000 that's right that's right well that's what she said to us she said now do you all want him to go to a a state college or a private college and
sw2062B-ms98-a-0057 333.902000 343.604375 and our answer was that you know we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college and if he wants to go to a private college he can get a scholarship
sw2062B-ms98-a-0058 343.604375 349.108375 to attend you know and that was kind of our view on it it just costs too much you just can't do it you know
sw2062B-ms98-a-0059 349.108375 360.095750 so i don't know it's it's i don't uh it just amazing it amazes me how much the the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years i just don't know how anybody's going to do it
sw2062B-ms98-a-0060 360.095750 371.338250 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0061 371.338250 373.676000 oh goodness
sw2062B-ms98-a-0062 373.676000 375.146625 yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0063 375.146625 376.686500 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0064 376.686500 379.951250 yeah exactly exactly
sw2062B-ms98-a-0065 379.951250 389.567625 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0066 389.567625 392.682000 that's right that's right [laughter]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0067 392.682000 403.240125 well you know TI you know TI offers some good stuff and then i think there's i mean i think there's some negatives but there's going to be some negatives anywhere you know no matter where you go i have
sw2062B-ms98-a-0068 403.240125 417.861000 you know all this is the first really large company i've worked for i've always been involved in little small you know ind[ividual]- privately owned [vocalized-noise] owned firms and so i've never had the the big benefit package so i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies you know it
sw2062B-ms98-a-0069 417.861000 425.906250 when i came on it was great see because_1 i had never had anything even close to what what they offered so i've been real pleased
sw2062B-ms98-a-0070 425.906250 426.034500 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0071 426.034500 428.296750 yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0072 428.296750 435.802250 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0073 435.802250 437.595875 think so
sw2062B-ms98-a-0074 437.595875 449.853125 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0075 449.853125 451.278875 um-hum
sw2062B-ms98-a-0076 451.278875 456.261375 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0077 456.261375 457.400750 yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0078 457.400750 460.294625 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0079 460.294625 463.639750 yeah and you can pick what you want and yeah
sw2062B-ms98-a-0080 463.639750 471.367500 right that sounds really good i read a thing i don't even remember if it was in the Dallas Site or the Inside one about uh
sw2062B-ms98-a-0081 471.367500 478.792750 companies allowing you and they said that TI was looking into it to purchase extra vacation days which i thought sounded like a good idea
sw2062B-ms98-a-0082 478.792750 485.908375 you know if you've been there you know under five years and you get two weeks of vacation but that's really not enough and you want an extra week
sw2062B-ms98-a-0083 485.908375 496.900750 then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying okay i'm going to want an extra five days this year and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck you know and they're deducting it all along so
sw2062B-ms98-a-0084 496.900750 507.140875 you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them_1 at the time you know you['re]- you're really not being paid for them_1 the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know
sw2062B-ms98-a-0085 507.140875 515.467500 so that is kind of an idea that that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in and TI said that they were looking into something like that so
sw2062B-ms98-a-0086 515.467500 523.313625 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0087 523.313625 524.653625 um-hum

sw2062B-ms98-a-0090 528.556375 530.903125 well true true

sw2062B-ms98-a-0099 561.594875 572.103000 um-hum well and yeah and and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person and
sw2062B-ms98-a-0100 572.103000 581.029625 you know i see a lot of differences but from one group to the next you know about who gets it and who doesn't get it you know but that's and that's that way with a lot of things you know
sw2062B-ms98-a-0101 581.029625 587.583375 there it seems like it depends on what what group you happen to be in what what you're going to get and what you're not going to get so [noise]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0102 587.583375 592.966125 which is the same but but then it's probably that way anywhere you know that's
sw2062B-ms98-a-0103 592.966125 594.662375 [silence]
sw2062B-ms98-a-0104 594.662375 596.322500 um-hum
