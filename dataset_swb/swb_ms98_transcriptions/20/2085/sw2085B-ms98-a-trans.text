sw2085B-ms98-a-0010 18.458000 25.259750 yeah this is a a very appropriate topic for our uh conversation today because
sw2085B-ms98-a-0011 25.259750 28.876125 what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making
sw2085B-ms98-a-0012 28.876125 30.221250 [laughter]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0013 30.221250 31.612250 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0014 31.612250 32.994250 what's that

sw2085B-ms98-a-0016 34.715000 36.154125 well
sw2085B-ms98-a-0017 36.154125 41.651375 we've got a pretty good situation uh my wife and i since our property's already paid for
sw2085B-ms98-a-0018 41.651375 47.051625 you know the main things that i like about the uh the job benefits
sw2085B-ms98-a-0019 47.051625 51.437375 would be the uh [noise] the availability of the health insurance
sw2085B-ms98-a-0020 51.437375 52.634750 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0021 52.634750 57.807375 and the availability of uh you know being able to transfer
sw2085B-ms98-a-0022 57.807375 60.421625 around inside the organization
sw2085B-ms98-a-0023 60.421625 67.360875 without having you know when they cut off a system and they don't just can everybody that's working on it like some companies i know of
sw2085B-ms98-a-0024 67.360875 72.014000 you know they give you an opportunity to transfer into uh an on going project
sw2085B-ms98-a-0025 72.014000 75.985000 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0026 75.985000 77.075250 yep

sw2085B-ms98-a-0033 128.680625 133.511750 yeah that's uh that's something i hadn't really thought about since we don't have children
sw2085B-ms98-a-0034 133.511750 137.667250 but i can see how it would be a real benefit
sw2085B-ms98-a-0035 137.667250 139.540250 those that do
sw2085B-ms98-a-0036 139.540250 163.942000 [silence]

sw2085B-ms98-a-0039 168.801750 171.616500 well that can i can see where that might be important
sw2085B-ms98-a-0040 171.616500 174.846625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0041 174.846625 176.171500 no
sw2085B-ms98-a-0042 176.171500 178.556000 i i don't know what you're talking about there
sw2085B-ms98-a-0043 178.556000 186.483625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0044 186.483625 190.643125 oh okay yeah yeah we got that pre tax insurance
sw2085B-ms98-a-0045 190.643125 191.694625 yeah
sw2085B-ms98-a-0046 191.694625 192.312125 [vocalized-noise]

sw2085B-ms98-a-0049 195.284250 199.094250 oh it's probably what the first guy who did it called it
sw2085B-ms98-a-0050 199.094250 202.955000 yeah he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of [laughter-it]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0051 202.955000 205.763125 [laughter]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0052 205.763125 209.119625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0053 209.119625 211.021875 i'll tell you what we could do
sw2085B-ms98-a-0054 211.021875 214.550500 we could prohibit people from being hired that are
sw2085B-ms98-a-0055 214.550500 218.766125 historically going to cost the company money
sw2085B-ms98-a-0056 218.766125 222.332375 you know do a little bit better research on who gets hired
sw2085B-ms98-a-0057 222.332375 225.652125 because you know i[f]-
sw2085B-ms98-a-0058 225.652125 230.052000 well no[t]- not only just health insurance i mean for the whole benefit of the company
sw2085B-ms98-a-0059 230.052000 234.306500 see i look at it this way if the company folds i got to go find a job
sw2085B-ms98-a-0060 234.306500 242.990125 okay now if we get somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs just about anybody in the company
sw2085B-ms98-a-0061 242.990125 246.850875 and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job then we should find
sw2085B-ms98-a-0062 246.850875 250.711625 a a place to put them_1 or b you know boot them_1 out
sw2085B-ms98-a-0063 250.711625 255.709250 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0064 255.709250 259.774750 well frankly i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid
sw2085B-ms98-a-0065 259.774750 262.198125 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0066 262.198125 263.623500 what
sw2085B-ms98-a-0067 263.623500 265.939500 oh well
sw2085B-ms98-a-0068 265.939500 267.552000 i'm i'm
sw2085B-ms98-a-0069 267.552000 269.631375 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0070 269.631375 270.914000 i know
sw2085B-ms98-a-0071 270.914000 272.197500 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0072 272.197500 280.192375 well there's two schools of thought on that you know i i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a professor
sw2085B-ms98-a-0073 280.192375 284.014375 i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that
sw2085B-ms98-a-0074 284.014375 285.432125 but
sw2085B-ms98-a-0075 285.432125 290.018625 once you get that job with the university then you've got ten years of probation
sw2085B-ms98-a-0076 290.018625 292.374750 then you have tenure
sw2085B-ms98-a-0077 292.374750 294.504250 and they can't fire you
sw2085B-ms98-a-0078 294.504250 302.848250 well you know in a situation like that i don't know if that's good or bad i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry
sw2085B-ms98-a-0079 302.848250 307.046875 and i've also had tenure professors that were the best things on two legs
sw2085B-ms98-a-0080 307.046875 314.388625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0081 314.388625 316.087000 but in addition
sw2085B-ms98-a-0082 316.087000 317.521125 um-hum
sw2085B-ms98-a-0083 317.521125 322.047375 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0084 322.047375 329.129500 well they they really can't fire you without cause anymore i mean you know the government's taken care of that
sw2085B-ms98-a-0085 329.129500 332.787375 but uh what i'm looking at is
sw2085B-ms98-a-0086 332.787375 334.474750 you know
sw2085B-ms98-a-0087 334.474750 342.847000 there are a lot of teachers out there that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors
sw2085B-ms98-a-0088 342.847000 347.998500 you know and i could see a point protecting someone's position
sw2085B-ms98-a-0089 347.998500 356.465250 but on the other hand i don't think it you know that someone that teaches uh say shop for instance should have to have a a degree at all
sw2085B-ms98-a-0090 356.465250 358.730125 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0091 358.730125 359.876125 well
sw2085B-ms98-a-0092 359.876125 361.234500 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0093 361.234500 366.489750 in some places they don't but you know you you've got specialized education now
sw2085B-ms98-a-0094 366.489750 369.415875 for instance take computer science
sw2085B-ms98-a-0095 369.415875 373.345750 you know we've got kids twenty years old
sw2085B-ms98-a-0096 373.345750 376.899000 right now that could beat any computer
sw2085B-ms98-a-0097 376.899000 382.258750 professor at microcomputer applications i know we do
sw2085B-ms98-a-0098 382.258750 388.233500 and these people can't even get jobs doing anything [vocalized-noise] besides digging ditches 
sw2085B-ms98-a-0099 388.233500 393.070500 because there's no comprehensive test that they can take
sw2085B-ms98-a-0100 393.070500 399.111375 that would allow them to s[tep]- to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college
sw2085B-ms98-a-0101 399.111375 407.312750 you know i went to college late on in life and i realize that hey you know it's nothing but four years of endurance and you might be teachable you know what i [laughter-mean]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0102 407.312750 408.400875 [laughter]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0103 408.400875 410.819250 i mean my agree is absolutely worthless
sw2085B-ms98-a-0104 410.819250 418.052000 it's my experience and and my knowledge that that is beneficial but then you know i like i said i came at it backwards
sw2085B-ms98-a-0105 418.052000 420.005000 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0106 420.005000 421.816500 Industrial Marketing
sw2085B-ms98-a-0107 421.816500 424.071875 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0108 424.071875 427.907250 well actually i'm selling computer software
sw2085B-ms98-a-0109 427.907250 430.991750 but the two are mutually exclusive
sw2085B-ms98-a-0110 430.991750 433.464375 because the
sw2085B-ms98-a-0111 433.464375 439.620750 it's experience that got me the job that i got now was my experience in the construction field prior to going to college
sw2085B-ms98-a-0112 439.620750 441.631625 not my degree
sw2085B-ms98-a-0113 441.631625 444.135250 which is i think kind of {bizzaro}
sw2085B-ms98-a-0114 444.135250 452.460625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0115 452.460625 453.639875 well let's
sw2085B-ms98-a-0116 453.639875 454.653125 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0117 454.653125 455.750625 that's
sw2085B-ms98-a-0118 455.750625 458.082750 we've already we've already got that
sw2085B-ms98-a-0119 458.082750 474.762500 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0120 474.762500 475.826875 um-hum

sw2085B-ms98-a-0122 479.359125 481.705625 well yeah
sw2085B-ms98-a-0123 481.705625 485.180500 supervisor evaluation's always been a tough one
sw2085B-ms98-a-0124 485.180500 488.520500 especially in my line because
sw2085B-ms98-a-0125 488.520500 493.637000 you know my supervisor has got really absolutely nothing to do with my job except make sure i get my check
sw2085B-ms98-a-0126 493.637000 495.383750 [laughter]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0127 495.383750 500.225500 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0128 500.225500 503.368375 well not really
sw2085B-ms98-a-0129 503.368375 506.578375 you know i mean i[t]- there's
sw2085B-ms98-a-0130 506.578375 509.286375 what what's to [evalu/evaluate] -[evalu]ate him on
sw2085B-ms98-a-0131 509.286375 510.777875 you know i mean
sw2085B-ms98-a-0132 510.777875 514.754500 uh my my supervisory level is like practically zero
sw2085B-ms98-a-0133 514.754500 516.783250 i run the whole show
sw2085B-ms98-a-0134 516.783250 522.865875 and when i need something i tell my boss and he gets it for me because_1 he knows that i know what i'm doing
sw2085B-ms98-a-0135 522.865875 524.799875 you know and uh
sw2085B-ms98-a-0136 524.799875 533.030250 that that is something that i think needs to be expanded on specially in the in the large market place you know the major corporation
sw2085B-ms98-a-0137 533.030250 542.139000 because so often you know you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas so to speak
sw2085B-ms98-a-0138 542.139000 543.151625 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0139 543.151625 548.215375 you know it's it's hard for me to y[ou]- you know especially since i'm in marketing sales
sw2085B-ms98-a-0140 548.215375 550.245875 you know i make more than my boss [noise]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0141 550.245875 553.468125 because he's salary and i'm not i make as much as i earn
sw2085B-ms98-a-0142 553.468125 555.553625 you know if i don't make a sale i don't make anything
sw2085B-ms98-a-0143 555.553625 556.465875 [laughter]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0144 556.465875 557.378125 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0145 557.378125 559.796875 yeah well it's a little tough
sw2085B-ms98-a-0146 559.796875 565.769375 but uh you know there are you know requirements and and quotas and what not for me to make
sw2085B-ms98-a-0147 565.769375 569.563250 but uh bottom line on on that kind of thing is
sw2085B-ms98-a-0148 569.563250 576.577250 you know we have a lot of people especially in major corporations who aren't doing a damn thing
sw2085B-ms98-a-0149 576.577250 578.933750 they're just there
sw2085B-ms98-a-0150 578.933750 587.385875 you know the work they do could be totally eliminated and not that they aren't working not that they aren't trying or anything it's just that their jobs are useless 
sw2085B-ms98-a-0151 587.385875 588.583000 [silence]
sw2085B-ms98-a-0152 588.583000 593.583500 you know take for instance um a large construction company i used to work for
sw2085B-ms98-a-0153 593.583500 600.101625 Ed Swampers Swampers' a guy who's in the union he's a laborer and he's assigned to
