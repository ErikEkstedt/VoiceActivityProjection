sw2085A-ms98-a-0018 89.042500 100.641625 you know now after you work i think five years they begin to pay most of it but then for the the family you know m[y]- i put my kids on my policy it's like two hundred dollars
sw2085A-ms98-a-0019 100.641625 111.110125 and it's gone up quite a bit and they predict you know of course it's going to keep going up i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage at some point
sw2085A-ms98-a-0020 111.110125 117.501875 and benefits you know i'd like to see child care paid for or or on-site ch[ild]- child care sometime
