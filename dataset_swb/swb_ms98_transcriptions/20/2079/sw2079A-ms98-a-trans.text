sw2079A-ms98-a-0003 64.625750 75.355500 well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he's in electronics but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it
sw2079A-ms98-a-0004 75.355500 78.318750 so it took him about two and a half years
sw2079A-ms98-a-0005 78.318750 81.072125 but uh he built us a house
sw2079A-ms98-a-0006 81.072125 85.227500 it's uh we have thirty two hundred square feet
sw2079A-ms98-a-0007 85.227500 88.396500 and it's a brick house
sw2079A-ms98-a-0008 88.396500 99.417625 and {pricewise} it wasn't great because he did it all {hisself} you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it
