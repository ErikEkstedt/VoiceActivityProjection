sw2079B-ms98-a-0002 3.480250 9.717125 okay we um i'm presently living in a house uh first time uh
sw2079B-ms98-a-0003 9.717125 15.048125 we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh [noise]
sw2079B-ms98-a-0004 15.048125 18.617375 um it was a really excitement to uh
sw2079B-ms98-a-0005 18.617375 19.659250 [noise]
sw2079B-ms98-a-0006 19.659250 27.471375 to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses
sw2079B-ms98-a-0007 27.471375 34.254875 and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home
sw2079B-ms98-a-0008 34.254875 38.526125 and they're good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart
sw2079B-ms98-a-0009 38.526125 40.877500 so i would um
sw2079B-ms98-a-0010 40.877500 46.932125 not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they're overpriced
sw2079B-ms98-a-0011 46.932125 60.009375 um but they're a cheap house if you can't afford something good you know they're good for that and um you can call it a home because_1 it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting
sw2079B-ms98-a-0012 60.009375 63.534875 uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it
sw2079B-ms98-a-0013 63.534875 65.570000 [noise] how about in your case
