sw2065B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 7.972625 okay
sw2065B-ms98-a-0002 7.972625 18.519250 i think it would be a great idea i'm not sure about requiring it you know of people because_1 people are going you know feeling resentful i don't know but i think it would be a great idea
sw2065B-ms98-a-0003 18.519250 31.264500 seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of you know what they want to be or do or you know they could learn [vocalized-noise] something and maybe help other people at the same time and we sure our country all countries sure need help so
sw2065B-ms98-a-0004 31.264500 39.707250 [silence]

sw2065B-ms98-a-0014 65.509750 67.826500 [silence]
sw2065B-ms98-a-0015 67.826500 77.422500 i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and
sw2065B-ms98-a-0016 77.422500 84.955625 but i don't know if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then may[be]- maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to
sw2065B-ms98-a-0017 84.955625 86.412000 really you know
sw2065B-ms98-a-0018 86.412000 88.875125 send children you know to do that
sw2065B-ms98-a-0019 88.875125 90.242625 i didn't know
sw2065B-ms98-a-0020 90.242625 93.318500 [silence]
sw2065B-ms98-a-0021 93.318500 99.636875 yeah i was too i thought seriously about joining at that time i thought it was a fantastic idea
sw2065B-ms98-a-0022 99.636875 106.607500 i sent off for stuff on it but i don't remember that much about it i know that they trained you in the language and um
sw2065B-ms98-a-0023 106.607500 108.420250 yeah
sw2065B-ms98-a-0024 108.420250 116.118625 you actually got paid too while in the Peace Corps it wasn't much but i guess they you could put some money aside while you were there your expenses were covered
sw2065B-ms98-a-0025 116.118625 120.144000 yeah i think so yeah yeah [laughter]
sw2065B-ms98-a-0026 120.144000 129.776750 but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids at a certain age and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex [laughter-and] [laughter-everything] [laughter-here] [laughter-and] [laughter-take] them and
sw2065B-ms98-a-0027 129.776750 136.955375 to some other country that had different moral [laughter-values] [laughter-something] like Saudi Arabia where they couldn't drink [laughter]
sw2065B-ms98-a-0028 136.955375 143.874250 really [laughter] yeah i hadn't thought about that um-hum

sw2065B-ms98-a-0043 212.127000 219.049750 the people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation you know like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that
sw2065B-ms98-a-0044 219.049750 223.198125 might not go if it was voluntary but i don't know how they'd enforce it if it was

sw2065B-ms98-a-0053 255.202625 262.002500 well it seems like it would develop pride you know in people if if it's in their own country it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the
sw2065B-ms98-a-0054 262.002500 276.212625 things that we have here and develop some pride in them if it was handled that way i i it would take quite a few people i think it might build jobs for people you know that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that so maybe that part of it would be helpful too
sw2065B-ms98-a-0055 276.212625 277.736500 i don't know
sw2065B-ms98-a-0056 277.736500 282.458750 [noise] i'd like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and [laughter] mow the [laughter-grass] and [laughter]

sw2065B-ms98-a-0066 311.902875 319.215500 yeah really there could be um some uh scandals involved if you know it wasn't people that were really fair and
sw2065B-ms98-a-0067 319.215500 331.876875 leaving it you know in a legal way or something they could send all the people over to you know one particular part of town or one particular project that somebody had paid somebody to you know get supported or
sw2065B-ms98-a-0068 331.876875 333.587625 it would be open for

sw2065B-ms98-a-0076 393.180875 405.813625 yeah well it seems like there's there's a a lot of you don't hear much on the news about young people really you know wanting to do anything good or anything like that but you know i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have
sw2065B-ms98-a-0077 405.813625 411.187250 good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing i just i saw on the news the other night that the uh
sw2065B-ms98-a-0078 411.187250 418.479750 the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the Cosby show Kisha Knight Pullman was starting a i guess now she's practically a teenager [laughter]
sw2065B-ms98-a-0079 418.479750 432.708500 she started some type of um [noise] national um organization for youth to volunteer like to teach tutor other kids to read and you know do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards
sw2065B-ms98-a-0080 432.708500 439.936000 [noise] you know helpful things and i know even like in the high schools in Dallas there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a um
sw2065B-ms98-a-0081 439.936000 449.344625 [noise] minority you know um i think it was in a Hispanic area they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers instead of they said ever[y]- all these gangs kids could join to belong
sw2065B-ms98-a-0082 449.344625 456.929750 but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing helping you know so they were trying to start that out so if there's people out there that are
sw2065B-ms98-a-0083 456.929750 462.461125 willing to you know kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy gosh we ought to use them_1 you know
