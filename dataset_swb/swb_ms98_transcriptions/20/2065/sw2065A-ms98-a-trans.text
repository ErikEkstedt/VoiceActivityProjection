sw2065A-ms98-a-0007 36.003250 45.871125 uh my only experience with it i was in Central America for a while and uh in San Salvador in El Salvador for instance everybody had what they called there social year
sw2065A-ms98-a-0008 45.871125 53.506875 that they that they had to put in and basically it was a uh repayment for for uh high school education
sw2065A-ms98-a-0009 53.506875 59.867125 and most of them joined the Red Cross and it was done internally i just there was very little external i think
sw2065A-ms98-a-0010 59.867125 69.018875 possibly what uh they're thinking about here more external Peace Corps type things where we're sending people off shore [vocalized-noise]

sw2065A-ms98-a-0016 98.392125 100.937125 did you ever get any information on it like

sw2065A-ms98-a-0018 105.682625 108.683625 that's that's what i was wondering about was whether they actually
sw2065A-ms98-a-0019 108.683625 110.568750 [silence]
sw2065A-ms98-a-0020 110.568750 111.952250 yeah was it

sw2065A-ms98-a-0024 132.958250 139.263750 where they couldn't do that yeah you might end up with a revolution i don't know which end though yeah [laughter]

sw2065A-ms98-a-0026 140.387375 146.618875 yeah yeah that's that's been interesting though the kids that have been over you know coming back right now you know
sw2065A-ms98-a-0027 146.618875 157.267375 you wonder if being exposed to that for a while what percentage of them_1 would actually say hey that's not a bad way to do it because from what i understand from some of the guys i know crime
sw2065A-ms98-a-0028 157.267375 162.540875 uh is punishable just almost uh instantly and
sw2065A-ms98-a-0029 162.540875 168.370000 in pub[lic]- yeah [vocalized-noise] and this sort of thing you know so you don't have just a whole lot of what we consider street crimes

sw2065A-ms98-a-0033 193.539250 202.124375 i- i think i agree with you one hundred percent about it being some sort of voluntary but when you do that then it becomes almost uh
sw2065A-ms98-a-0034 202.124375 205.551500 [vocalized-noise] or it can be
sw2065A-ms98-a-0035 205.551500 209.639375 you know there are people will kind of set up their own little club
sw2065A-ms98-a-0036 209.639375 211.976750 [noise] and uh but if

sw2065A-ms98-a-0055 281.923875 288.004125 well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do
sw2065A-ms98-a-0056 288.004125 289.895625 you know if uh
sw2065A-ms98-a-0057 289.895625 295.800375 you know if it's run by the individual state you know like CCC was run by the army and in effect
sw2065A-ms98-a-0058 295.800375 303.169375 and [noise] the only opposition to it really was that it was you know s[tarting]- starting some sort of a military elitist type
sw2065A-ms98-a-0059 303.169375 312.101250 you know special corps of uh cadre of people that sort of thing and uh when the politics of it get real confusing

sw2065A-ms98-a-0064 337.058125 347.784875 if the racial make up of the group was such and such you know they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and you know all this kind of thing
sw2065A-ms98-a-0065 347.784875 350.749875 oh yeah suppose uh
sw2065A-ms98-a-0066 350.749875 360.585750 well you know they they had a group of people who were construction oriented and they went and they they built uh [laughter] can't think of a good example a swimming pool or anything
sw2065A-ms98-a-0067 360.585750 368.984375 you know and one you can you can only build it in one place you know and know matter where you build it somebody else is going to scream well you didn't build one over here

sw2065A-ms98-a-0074 381.067500 383.392250 joke i heard once about uh
sw2065A-ms98-a-0075 383.392250 387.851625 elephant foot soup you know it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot
sw2065A-ms98-a-0076 387.851625 393.453000 it's it's uh it's the logistics of the thing that uh that that gets you going
