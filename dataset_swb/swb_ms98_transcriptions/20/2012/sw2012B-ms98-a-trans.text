sw2012B-ms98-a-0002 50.937000 55.964750 i i think i agree with that i think in a good example on the
sw2012B-ms98-a-0003 55.964750 66.660000 typical thing that happens uh when the phone rang and it's TI calling my immediate reaction is th[at]- -[i]t's some sort of strange phone message and then i realize oh no this is something i solicited
sw2012B-ms98-a-0004 66.660000 80.142000 so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion but after that i realized no i i really wanted this and it was sort of exciting and so that was almost an example of a si[tuation]- an invasion that turns out to be not invasive
sw2012B-ms98-a-0005 80.142000 82.214000 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0006 82.214000 88.612750 exactly uh and at the same time i think that i receive on on the order of
sw2012B-ms98-a-0007 88.612750 99.483000 uh probably seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it
sw2012B-ms98-a-0008 99.483000 101.756250 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0009 101.756250 106.287875 commercial soli[citations]- solicitations primarily
sw2012B-ms98-a-0010 106.287875 119.494375 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0011 119.494375 121.224125 yeah
sw2012B-ms98-a-0012 121.224125 135.973000 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0013 135.973000 147.803125 and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control and you one's feeling obligated because uh some sense of of the way the ritual is played out
sw2012B-ms98-a-0014 147.803125 153.231500 and and uh that that then ends up being the the most common example for me
sw2012B-ms98-a-0015 153.231500 156.526500 um i guess i'm not
sw2012B-ms98-a-0016 156.526500 161.867375 typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this second
sw2012B-ms98-a-0017 161.867375 173.257375 thi[s]- one that you raised and i don't think i would have thought about that i think that's a good idea on your part i don't typically feel intruded on on the things oh in the sense of finding out information
sw2012B-ms98-a-0018 173.257375 199.502875 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0019 199.502875 203.072625 to s[urmise]- to surmise it is there
sw2012B-ms98-a-0020 203.072625 209.477125 [vocalized-noise]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0021 209.477125 212.215500 well i guess although
sw2012B-ms98-a-0022 212.215500 227.041750 i well that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is because uh if that's the case of a tree falling in the forest and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded
sw2012B-ms98-a-0023 227.041750 237.383250 um if your defining it in terms of information gone even if it's something you don't know about it well then i guess one could assume one was invaded but i don't feel invaded by it
sw2012B-ms98-a-0024 237.383250 251.394875 i don't have a sense of threat in general from those sorts of things i'm not sure why uh i guess it comes from a sense of facts or facts and if someone finds out something about me that is true i i don't have a sense of loss from that
sw2012B-ms98-a-0025 251.394875 252.977500 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0026 252.977500 264.858000 [laughter] uh the the other side of that might be uh if if s[omeone]- there's someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense
sw2012B-ms98-a-0027 264.858000 267.007625 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0028 267.007625 274.064375 bec[ause]- right because you don't have anyway to turn it off the[re]- did you hear about this Lotus database that was being put together
sw2012B-ms98-a-0029 274.064375 276.537500 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0030 276.537500 287.278125 that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there'd be cou[ld]- good possibility that their facts were were fantasy
sw2012B-ms98-a-0031 287.278125 301.941750 and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information from me that i would rather they didn't and that might be the sense of a spending pattern for instance that that i would have thought to be private but then if it turns out to generate
sw2012B-ms98-a-0032 301.941750 311.491625 incorrect things that's even worse uh or if my call rate of of eight t[o]- or so a week went up even higher because [laughter] uh someone had had [vocalized-noise]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0033 311.491625 320.117375 right as a person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money and then all of a sudden you get your thirty a week because now their advertising you right exactly
sw2012B-ms98-a-0034 320.117375 334.644625 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0035 334.644625 336.802375 right right

sw2012B-ms98-a-0037 342.603625 344.215375 right

sw2012B-ms98-a-0039 364.514250 366.015625 um-hum
sw2012B-ms98-a-0040 366.015625 376.729750 and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling threatened as a result of of it so s[o]- maybe that is a a little bit of what privacy is
sw2012B-ms98-a-0041 376.729750 401.517625 [silence]

sw2012B-ms98-a-0044 417.993250 420.282500 oh that's interesting
sw2012B-ms98-a-0045 420.282500 422.499875 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0046 422.499875 426.304750 but but no concept for wanting to be private
sw2012B-ms98-a-0047 426.304750 430.188500 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0048 430.188500 431.770625 okay

sw2012B-ms98-a-0050 441.638375 444.998875 oh th[at]- that would be

sw2012B-ms98-a-0052 446.189125 449.265750 that'd be culturally [laughter-shocking]

sw2012B-ms98-a-0054 453.806125 455.579500 uh-huh

sw2012B-ms98-a-0059 493.506250 500.710625 that that is true i hadn't thought about that and and that is fascinating to to think about someone who doesn't know how to say private
sw2012B-ms98-a-0060 500.710625 505.772875 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0061 505.772875 507.985500 [laughter]

sw2012B-ms98-a-0067 548.638625 561.088750 that's interesting are th[ere]- are there any other specific things that that you feel like where where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a day-to-day basis or either g[rowing]- on a growing frequency
sw2012B-ms98-a-0068 561.088750 583.404875 [silence]
sw2012B-ms98-a-0069 583.404875 585.317125 okay

sw2012B-ms98-a-0071 593.979500 597.762000 so that's another example of the invasion because of a nonsol[icited]-
