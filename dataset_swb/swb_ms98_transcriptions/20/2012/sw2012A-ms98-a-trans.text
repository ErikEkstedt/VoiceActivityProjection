sw2012A-ms98-a-0002 2.971625 10.321375 well the first thing for me is i wonder i see a couple of different ways of talking about what privacy is um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0003 10.321375 18.671000 if privacy is something that disturbs your private state i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state that's
sw2012A-ms98-a-0004 18.671000 31.994625 one thing and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it in other words finds something out about you that's another and the first kind of
sw2012A-ms98-a-0005 31.994625 43.224125 invasion of the first type of privacy seems invaded to me in very much everyday in this country but in the second type at least overtly uh where someone comes in and uh
sw2012A-ms98-a-0006 43.224125 48.247000 finds out information about you that should be private uh does not seem uh
sw2012A-ms98-a-0007 48.247000 54.441375 um obviously everyday
sw2012A-ms98-a-0008 54.441375 65.700875 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0009 65.700875 68.723125 [laughter-that's] [laughter-right]

sw2012A-ms98-a-0011 73.762250 75.429250 uh-huh

sw2012A-ms98-a-0013 79.750250 83.967875 right it turned out to be uh uh an invitation [noise]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0014 83.967875 97.629750 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0015 97.629750 104.697000 from from personal parties or from these uh phone answer[ing]- phone uh commercial things
sw2012A-ms98-a-0016 104.697000 116.463875 oh that that's a remarkable number i get them rarely and i'm still astounded that that uh one they let anyone do them and two that they have any effectiveness whatsoever [laughter] um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0017 116.463875 121.423125 because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what they are
sw2012A-ms98-a-0018 121.423125 123.841875 i think they prey on people's um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0019 123.841875 137.726750 inherent politeness on the phone even with a machine i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there
sw2012A-ms98-a-0020 137.726750 142.973875 [silence]

sw2012A-ms98-a-0029 171.457875 180.121500 well presumably those who find out such information if they are doing it i would prefer to not to be known and i mean you know the classic
sw2012A-ms98-a-0030 180.121500 187.568250 oh i don't know CIA conspiracy theories or whatever would have uh such parties trying to do it without your knowledge so there's
sw2012A-ms98-a-0031 187.568250 191.258375 things that invade that second type of privacy
sw2012A-ms98-a-0032 191.258375 197.243750 where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it and
sw2012A-ms98-a-0033 197.243750 210.782875 i can't talk about the second one other than to to to generate paranoia [laughter] [laughter-yeah] [laughter-to] [laughter-surmise] and i'd like to think that's it's quite low at least in this country i don't feel like the KGB is monitoring my phone or anything like that

sw2012A-ms98-a-0045 272.823250 277.673125 yes i did i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it

sw2012A-ms98-a-0055 315.298625 316.316875 yeah

sw2012A-ms98-a-0057 317.216000 318.810500 yeah
sw2012A-ms98-a-0058 318.810500 330.499250 yeah and i one of the problems with the Lotus database was uh that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information i mean they said they would give it out to only select companies but
sw2012A-ms98-a-0059 330.499250 341.706875 uh you know just like software is only given out to customers i mean you can't believe that [laughter] it would it would be pirated and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering
sw2012A-ms98-a-0060 341.706875 350.995375 you know full cash price for it i mean you know you can't tell what what a company really has to do with it and there's something rather ominous about having
sw2012A-ms98-a-0061 350.995375 357.245750 virtually anyone any hacker being able to know what your income is what your spending habits are and you know and
sw2012A-ms98-a-0062 357.245750 366.996125 and that hacker just has to get into in touch with a sneak thief and suddenly and then what started as an invasion of privacy can be you know an invasion of your actual home
sw2012A-ms98-a-0063 366.996125 370.782875 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0064 370.782875 372.242375 yeah
sw2012A-ms98-a-0065 372.242375 374.408250 yes exactly
sw2012A-ms98-a-0066 374.408250 376.843000 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0067 376.843000 384.138375 um-hum i also hm thought about it because_1 i was uh waiting to talk to you that another thing
sw2012A-ms98-a-0068 384.138375 390.728375 that occurred to me is there's not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't
sw2012A-ms98-a-0069 390.728375 404.673500 but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy if i deviate from social norms of behavior if i run up and down the street yelling or something someone's gonna invade my privacy very quickly and
sw2012A-ms98-a-0070 404.673500 407.055500 i realize that that i mean
sw2012A-ms98-a-0071 407.055500 410.960500 i can take that for granted but i used to i used to live in India and
sw2012A-ms98-a-0072 410.960500 424.998875 things are quite different there in terms of that there's less of a sense of privacy in fact it's said that no Indian language has a word for privacy certainly a language i know doesn't but just has a word for loneliness loneliness is the closest you can come which is really quite different
sw2012A-ms98-a-0073 424.998875 426.267500 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0074 426.267500 431.635000 yeah it's it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state at least officially [noise] 
sw2012A-ms98-a-0075 431.635000 441.459875 um so there's not i mean doors don't have latches on them people don't tend to knock you just if there's a door closed you open it because_1 it's in your way you people walk in and out and
sw2012A-ms98-a-0076 441.459875 448.231750 as a as a westerner in India i was often surprised and felt my sense of privacy there was quite invaded
sw2012A-ms98-a-0077 448.231750 454.998000 you know it it very much is but on the other hand i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic
sw2012A-ms98-a-0078 454.998000 457.168500 and people would leave me alone
sw2012A-ms98-a-0079 457.168500 468.615625 whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much if you go out and act like the lunatic you you violate the uh the norms of socia[l]- of um public behavior um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0080 468.615625 479.793250 people start paying attention to you very much and they start asking questions and in a sense are invite invade invading your privacy although if you know what the social norms are you know quote unquote you asked for it
sw2012A-ms98-a-0081 479.793250 485.739000 but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms
sw2012A-ms98-a-0082 485.739000 494.994875 and which isn't al[way]- always the case in all cultures and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now th[at]- i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative
sw2012A-ms98-a-0083 494.994875 501.313625 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0084 501.313625 503.192625 um-hum um-hum
sw2012A-ms98-a-0085 503.192625 517.964000 and they've really um well i mean i i wonder how people have sex and things [laughter-like] [laughter-that] i mean they o[bviously]- [laughter] you go to India and it's obvious you know the results of sex are quite [laughter-obvious] as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years um but i i just don't quite
sw2012A-ms98-a-0086 517.964000 519.391250 um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0087 519.391250 532.657875 there's hope i actually for all for the time i've spent there i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy
sw2012A-ms98-a-0088 532.657875 538.311000 because_1 anyone can be alone for oh some period of time but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that
sw2012A-ms98-a-0089 538.311000 549.947750 there's this invisible barrier around me which people will re[spect]- will respect and if that's gone um i i r[eally]- really don't know how to live very well and i wonder i really do wonder how people do that
sw2012A-ms98-a-0090 549.947750 560.483750 [silence]
sw2012A-ms98-a-0091 560.483750 569.167500 well the class[ic]- the other classic examples the Jehovah's Witness or or Mormons or someone knocking at the front door um
sw2012A-ms98-a-0092 569.167500 577.964125 which is more intrusive because i have to f[eel]- really tell someone to go away and there's that sense of i have now opened my door they now see
sw2012A-ms98-a-0093 577.964125 586.497375 what i look like what i live like and norm[ally]- and they're doing something that normally i really only invite people to because i
sw2012A-ms98-a-0094 586.497375 595.510125 any f[riend]- anyone any friend anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me but no one is just welcome to come by my house so that is more of a sense of invasion
sw2012A-ms98-a-0095 595.510125 597.762000 [noise]
