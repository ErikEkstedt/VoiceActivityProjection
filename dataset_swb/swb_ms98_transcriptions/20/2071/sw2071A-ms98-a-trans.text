sw2071A-ms98-a-0021 97.666375 106.188250 well um the last car we bought was American because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um
sw2071A-ms98-a-0022 106.188250 111.738250 several things about the car it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be
sw2071A-ms98-a-0023 111.738250 123.631125 because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new
sw2071A-ms98-a-0024 123.631125 131.219500 you know we bought the car new and after [noise] um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch
sw2071A-ms98-a-0025 131.219500 137.076375 and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when
sw2071A-ms98-a-0026 137.076375 144.427250 brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable
sw2071A-ms98-a-0027 144.427250 148.018250 yeah so that was that was kind of a shock

sw2071A-ms98-a-0029 149.090625 155.803875 [silence]
sw2071A-ms98-a-0030 155.803875 166.036250 yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like like uh
sw2071A-ms98-a-0031 166.036250 175.565250 um a Mercedes Benz they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable
sw2071A-ms98-a-0032 175.565250 179.925125 you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a Mercedes
sw2071A-ms98-a-0033 179.925125 182.680875 especially not after two years
