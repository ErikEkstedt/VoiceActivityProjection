sw2005A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 11.287375 okay uh first um i need to know uh h[ow]- how do you feel about uh about sending um an elderly uh family member to a nursing home
sw2005A-ms98-a-0002 11.287375 20.980875 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0003 20.980875 22.967750 yes yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0004 22.967750 31.236750 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0005 31.236750 32.954250 um-hum
sw2005A-ms98-a-0006 32.954250 44.481250 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0007 44.481250 46.442250 yes
sw2005A-ms98-a-0008 46.442250 77.444750 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0009 77.444750 78.996375 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0010 78.996375 85.984375 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0011 85.984375 87.465875 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0012 87.465875 97.971250 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0013 97.971250 112.239500 um-hum yeah probably the hardest thing in in my family uh my grandmother she had to be put in nursing home and um she had used a walker for for quite sometime probably about six to nine months and um
sw2005A-ms98-a-0014 112.239500 125.702000 she had a fall and uh finally uh she had uh Parkinson's Disease and it got so much that she could not take care of her house sh[e]- then she lived in an apartment and um
sw2005A-ms98-a-0015 125.702000 131.506500 that was even harder actually because it was you know it was just a change of
sw2005A-ms98-a-0016 131.506500 145.243375 change of location and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling i mean she tr[aveled]- she had she had children all across the United States and you know she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children
sw2005A-ms98-a-0017 145.243375 155.860750 and um that was pretty heartrending for her i think when she finally came to the realization that you know no i cannot i cannot take care of myself
sw2005A-ms98-a-0018 155.860750 160.676750 yeah i mean for somebody who is you know for most of their life has has uh
sw2005A-ms98-a-0019 160.676750 173.970875 not just merely had a farm but had ten children had a farm ran everything because her husband was away in the coal mines and you know facing that situation it it's quite a dilemma i think
sw2005A-ms98-a-0020 173.970875 185.294250 yeah well my uh my uh probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthened for our family was rather than have one child make that decision
sw2005A-ms98-a-0021 185.294250 197.980250 than just delegate it i think that they they had a great deal of um all the brothers and sisters got together and they actually had a conference and i mean it was just it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family
sw2005A-ms98-a-0022 197.980250 208.998750 getting down together and doing that and and just the children were involved in the decision because it involved just them and you know making that decision and then
sw2005A-ms98-a-0023 208.998750 221.283375 finding a place and everybody had duties to perform you know whether it was just you know giving money or whether it was actually taking part in in a lot of the decision making you know like finding a a proper nursing home
sw2005A-ms98-a-0024 221.283375 235.435250 and they i know they and well they had well they had they had seen it coming so so i mean it i mean i i i i hard[ly]- i i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like that for me
sw2005A-ms98-a-0025 235.435250 242.472625 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0026 242.472625 246.486000 yeah yeah well we we yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0027 246.486000 249.727500 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0028 249.727500 250.677875 um-hum
sw2005A-ms98-a-0029 250.677875 260.453000 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0030 260.453000 261.729375 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0031 261.729375 270.686000 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0032 270.686000 272.209375 um-hum
sw2005A-ms98-a-0033 272.209375 282.600750 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0034 282.600750 290.144375 yeah yeah well with my with my grandmother i think it was it was such that uh that she did not have the problem with
sw2005A-ms98-a-0035 290.144375 290.222625 [noise]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0036 290.222625 300.616125 she was very well aware and her daughter came and visited her at least her daughter came and visited her and also her uh several grandchildren came and visited her everyday
sw2005A-ms98-a-0037 300.616125 307.412625 and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest
sw2005A-ms98-a-0038 307.412625 312.840875 um i- i- i think it would be it was more of a relief for her
sw2005A-ms98-a-0039 312.840875 325.431625 and um i mean but she was truly she was truly aware i mean i i di[dn't]- i don't know how i would how i would deal if if one of my parents came with with Alzheimer's or something like that which is which is far more devastating
sw2005A-ms98-a-0040 325.431625 327.477375 and um
sw2005A-ms98-a-0041 327.477375 334.179125 i i th[ink]- i think that what one thing that w[as]- that they were really concerned with probably was the fact
sw2005A-ms98-a-0042 334.179125 344.231750 it wasn't necessarily you know like the quantity of care but the quality of care that the people that work there were very
sw2005A-ms98-a-0043 344.231750 354.645250 were very interested that to make it as close a home environment as possible i i think i think i think you know for myself i i see that as probably the the
sw2005A-ms98-a-0044 354.645250 360.983875 what everything would hinge upon is it how close is it to a home environment that's the that's probably the major question
sw2005A-ms98-a-0045 360.983875 365.248000 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0046 365.248000 366.848625 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0047 366.848625 367.976625 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0048 367.976625 369.276875 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0049 369.276875 375.336875 yeah you know it's it's interesting that that a lot of the population in the United States is changing because
sw2005A-ms98-a-0050 375.336875 381.310750 you know uh now that so many more minorities where they have had extended families for such a long time
sw2005A-ms98-a-0051 381.310750 390.784625 um i[n]- matter of fact in the United States we used to have extended families it wasn't but i guess as we become more industrialized and more you know less in a rural situation
sw2005A-ms98-a-0052 390.784625 401.230250 we we don't we we we choose not to deal with the extended family because we feel it's kind of cumbersome when in reality it makes things much much easier
sw2005A-ms98-a-0053 401.230250 402.708375 uh
sw2005A-ms98-a-0054 402.708375 403.954250 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0055 403.954250 408.492250 yeah yeah i i i think that perhaps perhaps the extended family
sw2005A-ms98-a-0056 408.492250 417.430750 you know that that it may be one of the solutions to a lot of things e[ven]- e[ven]- even child care you know i mean of course there there comes other issues you know whether or not
sw2005A-ms98-a-0057 417.430750 426.950750 any of the grandparents [laughter-would] [laughter-we] [laughter-feel] [laughter-they're] [laughter-gonna] [laughter-be] [laughter-a] [laughter-good] [laughter] they're gonna be a good caretaker for our children but i mean they raised us after all
sw2005A-ms98-a-0058 426.950750 429.434375 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0059 429.434375 439.727125 yeah but uh i'm i i think that you know i mean we always uh i mean i've i've had a a lot of good experiences with uh with many many people
sw2005A-ms98-a-0060 439.727125 446.447875 especially where they've had uh extended family and i and an[d]- i i kind of see that that you know perhaps
sw2005A-ms98-a-0061 446.447875 454.484750 you know we may need to like get close to the family environment and and get down to the values of you know i mean uh it's
sw2005A-ms98-a-0062 454.484750 463.984750 money seems to be too big of an issue wi[th]- with with with with with what's going on today and i i think i think that we may not you know that may be
sw2005A-ms98-a-0063 463.984750 475.969875 you know perhaps if we put money on the back burner that may that may choose to alleviate a lot of the problems i mean [noise] i mean we may not we may not have as [noise] high a standard of living but
sw2005A-ms98-a-0064 475.969875 480.243000 the qua[lity]- but actually have a truer standard of living
sw2005A-ms98-a-0065 480.243000 481.746750 [silence]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0066 481.746750 483.486625 yeah yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0067 483.486625 484.843250 yeah
sw2005A-ms98-a-0068 484.843250 485.521500 [noise]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0069 485.521500 487.842375 okay well
sw2005A-ms98-a-0070 487.842375 490.532250 i guess that was it [laughter]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0071 490.532250 491.049625 [noise]
sw2005A-ms98-a-0072 491.049625 494.768375 okay all right hey bye-bye
