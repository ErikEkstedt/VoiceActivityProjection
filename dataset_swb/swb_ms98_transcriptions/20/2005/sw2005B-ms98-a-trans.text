sw2005B-ms98-a-0002 10.442500 21.679000 well of course it's you know it's it one of the last few things in the world you'd ever want to do you know unless it's just you know really you know f[or]- and for their uh you know for their own good
sw2005B-ms98-a-0003 21.679000 32.549000 i'd be very very careful and uh you know checking them out uh our had t[o]- place my mother in a nursing home she had a rather massive stroke about uh
sw2005B-ms98-a-0004 32.549000 35.494750 uh s[ix]- eight months ago i guess
sw2005B-ms98-a-0005 35.494750 38.470250 and uh we were i was fortunate in that
sw2005B-ms98-a-0006 38.470250 45.258625 i was personally acquainted with the uh people who uh ran the nursing home in our little hometown
sw2005B-ms98-a-0007 45.258625 56.448000 so i was very comfortable you know in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it but there's well i had an occasion for my uh mother-in-law who
sw2005B-ms98-a-0008 56.448000 65.946750 had fell and needed to be you know could not take care of herself anymore was confined to a nursing home for a while that was really not a very good experience uh
sw2005B-ms98-a-0009 65.946750 71.492875 it had to be done in a hurry i mean we didn't have you know like six months to check all of these places out
sw2005B-ms98-a-0010 71.492875 74.498375 and it was really not not very good uh
sw2005B-ms98-a-0011 74.498375 77.665000 deal we were not really happy with the
sw2005B-ms98-a-0012 77.665000 83.995750 nursing home that we finally had fortunately she only had to stay a few weeks and she was able to to return to her apartment again
sw2005B-ms98-a-0013 83.995750 88.273375 but it's really a big uh big decision as to you know when to do it 
sw2005B-ms98-a-0014 88.273375 100.422125 you know is there something else we could have done you know in checking out all the places that uh might be available course there's you know there's not one on every corner especially in you know smaller areas smaller towns

sw2005B-ms98-a-0066 271.146250 282.961750 that nursing home life would not have been you know anything of her choosing of course she would she would not have been happy there at all but uh as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us
