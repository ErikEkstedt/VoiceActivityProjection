sw2010A-ms98-a-0032 113.105375 125.609250 um [noise] the other one Silence of the Lambs is kind of a a gory movie if if somebody's not into that kind of stuff it's it's pretty graphic at points but uh i think they're both excellent movies

sw2010A-ms98-a-0045 192.894250 201.401125 he wanted to direct it he wanted to a[ct]- to star in it you know he he enjoyed the story line and i think he just really w[anted]- he really wanted it whether it
sw2010A-ms98-a-0046 201.401125 207.576750 whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office i think he would have been happy because
sw2010A-ms98-a-0047 207.576750 216.185750 i think that i think he did a good job and and the self-satisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him
