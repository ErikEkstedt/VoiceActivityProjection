sw2091B-ms98-a-0003 8.527875 15.905250 well i think the biggest change in like the last fifty years has been the increased number of women who work
sw2091B-ms98-a-0004 15.905250 21.088625 now i think overall there's been a change i don't think um that's uh
sw2091B-ms98-a-0005 21.088625 35.433000 been surpassed by anything else than uh that because most women seem to be taking into careers and working now and changing the way the family situation is because they're now working and we have to have people to babysit and such
sw2091B-ms98-a-0006 35.433000 67.745750 [silence]
sw2091B-ms98-a-0007 67.745750 70.357250 employed outside the home now
sw2091B-ms98-a-0008 70.357250 79.000875 [silence]
sw2091B-ms98-a-0009 79.000875 80.639625 [laughter]
sw2091B-ms98-a-0010 80.639625 83.140000 [silence]
sw2091B-ms98-a-0011 83.140000 89.558125 more visible things and things that use different kinds of mental skills
sw2091B-ms98-a-0012 89.558125 96.442125 maybe that's a a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending on uh
sw2091B-ms98-a-0013 96.442125 107.176750 you know how big the house is and whether you had you know a lot of children may not take as much mental skills and such as what working outside the home does
sw2091B-ms98-a-0014 107.176750 116.575000 uh i think a lot of the modern conveniences today you know have eliminated matter of fact you know i think women
sw2091B-ms98-a-0015 116.575000 126.659375 even back maybe two hundred years ago when we were first starting the country may have been looked at a little differently because it was really important to have the woman there
sw2091B-ms98-a-0016 126.659375 133.522625 and she probably you know gave half of the uh work output in like a farm
sw2091B-ms98-a-0017 133.522625 139.894750 you know her skills were as needed as the man's to you know to like establish a farm from the beginning
sw2091B-ms98-a-0018 139.894750 154.311625 and then it got to be that you know with the industrial age i think the women uh were the ones staying at home and not as involved in like a big operation as a farm and their the work was more confined to the household chores
sw2091B-ms98-a-0019 154.311625 161.708125 which didn't really uh have as much to do with the whole livelihood of the family if you were in a farm situation
sw2091B-ms98-a-0020 161.708125 175.555500 it's kind of kind of kind of gone all the way around that way in the beginning you know their work input for a farm and even like putting in the crops and harvesting and such was as important as the man's you know needed both
sw2091B-ms98-a-0021 175.555500 187.557125 and then she got to be kind of in the house when that wasn't needed as much and now she's kind of like back out of the house but not working for the family business working you know somewhere else
sw2091B-ms98-a-0022 187.557125 208.626750 [silence]
sw2091B-ms98-a-0023 208.626750 209.736250 [laughter-yeah]

sw2091B-ms98-a-0026 255.460625 269.369250 well some are kind of forced to but i did see something in the paper today i didn't read it through thoroughly but there was uh article about a a project a study that Elizabeth Dole had started when she was still at the Department of Labor
sw2091B-ms98-a-0027 269.369250 272.702500 something called Glass Ceiling it was trying to look at
sw2091B-ms98-a-0028 272.702500 285.596875 how uh much opportunity there is for women executives to move up they're still saying that there are too many women in higher uh echelons as management you know CEO's and that kind of thing
sw2091B-ms98-a-0029 285.596875 298.124750 n[o]- no there's not many they're saying that there's kind of like a glass ceiling that uh you just don't find too many women in those positions i think it will just kind of take time um 
sw2091B-ms98-a-0030 298.124750 308.205750 you know for women to be more acce[pted]- you know accepted into those kinds of areas and to have progressed education and {experiencewise} i mean
sw2091B-ms98-a-0031 308.205750 317.800875 starting with women working a lot in the work force in the last twenty years it takes awhile for somebody to really gain enough skills to be a CEO
sw2091B-ms98-a-0032 317.800875 323.877125 and i'm a little frustrated too because a lot of women who have their own businesses
sw2091B-ms98-a-0033 323.877125 335.643625 still don't seem to have gotten away from what we might kind of consider a more woman kind of business i call it like the three C's [laughter] like they're into cookies like Mrs Fields
sw2091B-ms98-a-0034 335.643625 341.762875 [laughter-and] [laughter] they're into cosmetics [noise] like Mary Kay and they're into uh clothing 
sw2091B-ms98-a-0035 341.762875 349.890875 you know but they haven't really branched out into some other things like you don't find too many women uh really involved with technology

sw2091B-ms98-a-0047 387.052125 389.222000 but historically
sw2091B-ms98-a-0048 389.222000 399.094000 [laughter] historically you think of cars being done by Ford and such so you don't want to think about a car now designed by a woman huh
