sw2039A-ms98-a-0074 339.696375 343.969500 [silence]
sw2039A-ms98-a-0075 343.969500 345.557375 yes i have
sw2039A-ms98-a-0076 345.557375 354.464375 [silence]
sw2039A-ms98-a-0077 354.464375 358.001250 well no that's it you could interpret it that way
sw2039A-ms98-a-0078 358.001250 359.316375 uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0079 359.316375 360.701250 i think
sw2039A-ms98-a-0080 360.701250 364.726625 what they're trying to say is that there is a great deal of
sw2039A-ms98-a-0081 364.726625 366.644625 historical truth
sw2039A-ms98-a-0082 366.644625 367.921000 [silence]
sw2039A-ms98-a-0083 367.921000 370.751250 but the interpretation that
sw2039A-ms98-a-0084 370.751250 373.361875 actually got into the um
sw2039A-ms98-a-0085 373.361875 377.245750 the writing of the Bible itself is probably
sw2039A-ms98-a-0086 377.245750 384.456750 uh after the what uh was it the King James Version when the committee
sw2039A-ms98-a-0087 384.456750 385.948625 uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0088 385.948625 397.993125 did it wr[ote]- wrote the uh the or translation that so much was lost in the translation uh particularly since most of the tr[anslations]- most of the translations were from Greek
sw2039A-ms98-a-0089 397.993125 405.761750 uh well for example uh in Greek there are seven different words for love
sw2039A-ms98-a-0090 405.761750 416.766750 okay so you can have there's one word for love of your brother one word for love of your wife one [ler/word] word for you know l[ove]- uh love of uh your father and that sort of thing
sw2039A-ms98-a-0091 416.766750 422.680250 so in those tr[anslations]- those types of interpretations uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0092 422.680250 434.630250 really made a difference in how one might interpret the Bible now and what it says so that you know it's it you know you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true but there's too much historical
sw2039A-ms98-a-0093 434.630250 436.920625 fact involved just from the
sw2039A-ms98-a-0094 436.920625 441.655500 uh the histories that are that were developed around that time that are available
sw2039A-ms98-a-0095 441.655500 448.707750 to deny that at least you know the majority of it is true so you know you know it depends on how you look at it
sw2039A-ms98-a-0096 448.707750 453.209125 you can look at it if you know if if you want to say that it's proving that
sw2039A-ms98-a-0097 453.209125 457.245625 it isn't true then you can you very much look at it that way
sw2039A-ms98-a-0098 457.245625 459.227000 [silence]
sw2039A-ms98-a-0099 459.227000 469.442500 yeah hey you [laughter-could] [laughter-well] you can interpret that the what the TV show in the same way you can interpret the Bible well uh so
sw2039A-ms98-a-0100 469.442500 478.520750 but uh i as as far as that goes i a[t]- we at we at least agree on you know on what we enjoy in that regard but uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0101 478.520750 482.976625 i don't know if there's a there is a time limit on this so uh
sw2039A-ms98-a-0102 482.976625 487.241500 i think so too all right well it's been very pleasant talking to you
sw2039A-ms98-a-0103 487.241500 489.073250 and have a good evening
sw2039A-ms98-a-0104 489.073250 490.173000 good night
