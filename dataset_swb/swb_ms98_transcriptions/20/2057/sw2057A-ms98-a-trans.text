sw2057A-ms98-a-0002 1.520375 6.641250 okay did it click okay um well how do you feel about food and cooking
sw2057A-ms98-a-0003 6.641250 14.058375 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0004 14.058375 15.701250 um-hum
sw2057A-ms98-a-0005 15.701250 25.022000 well we're vegetarians and we just became vegetarians for i i just became a vegetarian over the past uh year and a half 
sw2057A-ms98-a-0006 25.022000 31.698375 and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and
sw2057A-ms98-a-0007 31.698375 39.482250 it's a real challenge not to become like what they call a junk food junkie where your menu is composed of
sw2057A-ms98-a-0008 39.482250 52.981125 uh things that you want to eat that aren't veg[etable]- you know that aren't don't contain meat products or don't contain animal products but maybe aren't you know uh balanced meal so to speak
sw2057A-ms98-a-0009 52.981125 57.826000 so but we we feel a lot better since we've become vegetarians
sw2057A-ms98-a-0010 57.826000 59.985375 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0011 59.985375 66.503375 i did at first but um not really no not i- i can't imagine eating meat
sw2057A-ms98-a-0012 66.503375 78.553625 um the reason i [tranged/changed] uh changed to become a vegetarian was for ethical reasons so the idea of me eating meet would be like eating something you know i- i think of it as something alive
sw2057A-ms98-a-0013 78.553625 83.754000 you know so it i can't do it you know f[or]- for me it's it just
sw2057A-ms98-a-0014 83.754000 94.869000 but i do sometimes when i smell meat you know when i smell particularly uh say steak or something you know that i- i do admit that i
sw2057A-ms98-a-0015 94.869000 103.588125 you know s[till]- wish you know that i could have that [laughter-flavor] but but i know what it i know what it is so i you know i don't want it but
sw2057A-ms98-a-0016 103.588125 110.412750 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0017 110.412750 118.215875 yeah you you'd be surprised the things i mean you could like tonight we're having um nature burgers which are like a grain burger
sw2057A-ms98-a-0018 118.215875 124.217500 and you can it's really pretty good i- i the people i serve it to like my sister and family members
sw2057A-ms98-a-0019 124.217500 136.094500 well my family members are vegetarians now basically i mean they're not they're not when they go out to eat they sometimes eat other m[eat]- you know meats and things but at home we eat vegetarian meals
sw2057A-ms98-a-0020 136.094500 141.521750 and uh you can ma[ke]- you know make uh pasta meals and
sw2057A-ms98-a-0021 141.521750 149.178500 different things that people are use to eating that wouldn't offend you know that they wouldn't be offended that there wasn't a meat there
sw2057A-ms98-a-0022 149.178500 157.850000 you know at the at the table or even pizzas you can make a pizza that's not that doesn't have any animal produ[ct]- animal you know
sw2057A-ms98-a-0023 157.850000 162.959125 you would have animal products it would have cheese but you know not meat
sw2057A-ms98-a-0024 162.959125 164.626875 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0025 164.626875 175.832625 yeah we do eat i- i had become for about three or four months i was a vegan which is a person that eats um no animal products no cheeses no eggs
sw2057A-ms98-a-0026 175.832625 184.210500 and that's even more difficult it's really hard to find the products and it's hard that's even harder to keep yourself from eating
sw2057A-ms98-a-0027 184.210500 189.243750 because it it adds so much to meals you know when you put cheese on something or
sw2057A-ms98-a-0028 189.243750 191.497125 you know it really [laughter-makes] [laughter-a] [laughter-difference]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0029 191.497125 198.956500 a[nd]- eggs yeah eggs my mother just said eggs it's hard to find substitutes for eggs when you're baking and cooking and things
sw2057A-ms98-a-0030 198.956500 210.172500 so although you can i mean there's cookbooks and there's ways to do it it's a lot more expensive too i think you know the the the market is just not made for a vegan so but um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0031 210.172500 212.822875 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0032 212.822875 221.275375 yeah it if well it really is because t[oday]- just today we were in the grocery store and they had lentils and i
sw2057A-ms98-a-0033 221.275375 232.373625 you know i wasn't really sure whether they would have lentils in the grocery store we've been living in Bermuda and in Bermuda they had a um [noise] a health food store that really had a lot of good stuff
sw2057A-ms98-a-0034 232.373625 244.968375 and where we're living now is a small town that really doesn't you know just having that kind health food store that caters to those kind of needs and you just have to hope that the grocery store will you know the bigger grocery stores
sw2057A-ms98-a-0035 244.968375 251.109750 and they actually had lentils which some stores don't have things like that you know which
sw2057A-ms98-a-0036 251.109750 254.841625 yeah see that lot of people don't and that's
sw2057A-ms98-a-0037 254.841625 264.401000 yeah like lentil soup or something people don't and that's such a good source of protein or like soybeans you know people think ugh they think it's something really
sw2057A-ms98-a-0038 264.401000 273.245000 horrible but there's a lot of things you can buy that have soybean products in them to begin with that you don't even know where in there so um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0039 273.245000 277.647375 it's it's just a matter of learning you know
sw2057A-ms98-a-0040 277.647375 278.780000 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0041 278.780000 281.295375 yeah so but it
sw2057A-ms98-a-0042 281.295375 288.998250 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0043 288.998250 290.269375 um-hum
sw2057A-ms98-a-0044 290.269375 297.954250 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0045 297.954250 304.302750 yeah well think of it a[s]- think of it like this takes a long time for meat to digest
sw2057A-ms98-a-0046 304.302750 318.305000 and you know if you've got that sitting in your stomach i mean even when you sleep it's still sitting there digesting so you you kind of giving your stomach a chance to relax a bit and not have to work so hard to digest all that meat
sw2057A-ms98-a-0047 318.305000 325.297250 you know because_1 it takes longer than some products some other foods in your stomach to digest that meat
sw2057A-ms98-a-0048 325.297250 326.778875 so
sw2057A-ms98-a-0049 326.778875 329.086000 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0050 329.086000 331.640000 [laughter] um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0051 331.640000 338.579250 you prepare a lot of vegetables and there's lots of different casseroles and things so you just make you ju[st]-
sw2057A-ms98-a-0052 338.579250 345.706625 no yeah you just you just well see at ours uh we're living with my family my folks now so
sw2057A-ms98-a-0053 345.706625 354.225625 you know they they have the turkey you know they do they ca[n't]- they you can't stop you know everyone's [laughter-life] but um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0054 354.225625 362.970500 i think if in our own house we didn't we would have things like a casserole things like that that centered more on
sw2057A-ms98-a-0055 362.970500 365.768375 the vegetables as far as
sw2057A-ms98-a-0056 365.768375 375.861625 we might have one special dish one special casserole that was our one special thing like the turkey you know with the main meal kind of thing
sw2057A-ms98-a-0057 375.861625 382.408125 and and i suppose because it's for me ethical we'd just play up the fact that
sw2057A-ms98-a-0058 382.408125 389.370875 Thanksgiving's you know is a time for everyone to give thanks [laughter-even] [laughter-turkey] you know yeah
sw2057A-ms98-a-0059 389.370875 390.641875 so
sw2057A-ms98-a-0060 390.641875 392.114125 um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0061 392.114125 398.359000 but it it's interesting finding different recipes although my [laughter-mother] is the one that cooks um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0062 398.359000 399.998750 which
sw2057A-ms98-a-0063 399.998750 405.677250 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0064 405.677250 415.994125 yeah yeah lots of them_1 lots of them_1 and uh i have this one in front of me right now as a matter of fact it's called Sundays at the Moosewood Restaurant and
sw2057A-ms98-a-0065 415.994125 428.937875 uh it's out of New York it's a pretty famous restaurant out of New York and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything
sw2057A-ms98-a-0066 428.937875 440.780500 [vocalized-noise] no we don't eat fish either but it the majority of the book is um vegetarian with no meats so or you know of any any kind of animal
sw2057A-ms98-a-0067 440.780500 443.973750 so there's quite a few out there
sw2057A-ms98-a-0068 443.973750 450.326000 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0069 450.326000 451.638125 um-hum
sw2057A-ms98-a-0070 451.638125 465.019500 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0071 465.019500 478.101625 yeah it's strange because well it it's not strange because i use to be the same way and i'm even to this day [vocalized-noise] you know some vegetables really turn me off but when you read so much information that says
sw2057A-ms98-a-0072 478.101625 490.855875 this is a healthier way to go you know and this is what your body wants this is what your body really needs and when you think about what is what's the real reason your eating i know i know it's for taste because_1 i'm boy am i a taste [laughter-person] but
sw2057A-ms98-a-0073 490.855875 498.856500 but r[eally]- the main reason is for fuel you know and and when you read so much information that tells you that meats
sw2057A-ms98-a-0074 498.856500 506.434375 and different animal products you know are causing uh can cause uh different kinds of diseases 
sw2057A-ms98-a-0075 506.434375 515.215500 you know [vocalized-noise] like h[eart]- heart diseases and different diabetes and things like that different kinds of diseases it's like uh is it really worth it
sw2057A-ms98-a-0076 515.215500 522.517625 and the people i- i really think in general people in the United States just don't eat enough vegetables you know because
sw2057A-ms98-a-0077 522.517625 536.679250 you can talk grain all you want as far as you know cleaning your system out so to speak but you can't beat vegetables to give you all the nutrients and vitamins and and the the the kind that you can't get from a little pill 
sw2057A-ms98-a-0078 536.679250 543.077000 because_1 your body doesn't doesn't syn[thesis]- synthesis in the same way that it does when it gets it in raw food you know
sw2057A-ms98-a-0079 543.077000 544.119750 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0080 544.119750 551.125375 yeah that's true that's true so you it's it's all important you know it's an all important thing that you
sw2057A-ms98-a-0081 551.125375 564.189375 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0082 564.189375 572.109375 i think you'd feel probably a lot healthier um [vocalized-noise] my a[lmost]- almost everyone in my family is is obese
sw2057A-ms98-a-0083 572.109375 575.742500 [silence]
sw2057A-ms98-a-0084 575.742500 586.069125 yeah i- i would say you know th[e]- almost everyone and uh exc[ept]- except me except myself and you know my husband but um
sw2057A-ms98-a-0085 586.069125 589.177750 and uh yeah i- i
sw2057A-ms98-a-0086 589.177750 597.676750 i don't know that my mother and father have [laughter-seen] [laughter-any] [laughter-improvements] since we've been here as far as them switching to meat <b_aside> but do you think you fill healthier mom <e_aside>
sw2057A-ms98-a-0087 597.676750 599.590500 sh[e]- my mother says she feels health[ier]-
