sw2050B-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 5.439000 well i haven't uh i've been working in my own home for just um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0002 5.439000 16.547500 about the last three years bu[t]- so i can just wear whatever i [laughter-want] around the house but before then i t[aught]- taught at the University of Houston and um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0003 16.547500 18.974250 so i tried to wear things that were
sw2050B-ms98-a-0004 18.974250 24.079750 comfortable but still tried to look you know [vocalized-noise]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0005 24.079750 37.329750 yes bu[t]- it wasn't quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didn't have as good control over the class
sw2050B-ms98-a-0006 37.329750 41.560375 and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike
sw2050B-ms98-a-0007 41.560375 45.047375 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0008 45.047375 46.583125 um-hum
sw2050B-ms98-a-0009 46.583125 52.379625 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0010 52.379625 53.807250 uh-huh
sw2050B-ms98-a-0011 53.807250 68.023500 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0012 68.023500 70.370375 oh that's nice [laughter]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0013 70.370375 75.995875 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0014 75.995875 77.887625 well do you um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0015 77.887625 82.804000 meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or
sw2050B-ms98-a-0016 82.804000 90.072625 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0017 90.072625 91.520125 um-hum
sw2050B-ms98-a-0018 91.520125 113.568375 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0019 113.568375 126.770125 well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what they're wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too
sw2050B-ms98-a-0020 126.770125 136.432250 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0021 136.432250 138.548875 um-hum um-hum
sw2050B-ms98-a-0022 138.548875 147.530125 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0023 147.530125 155.719000 well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0024 155.719000 163.792750 that because i taught English as a second language so i didn't have your average freshman student and um so i
sw2050B-ms98-a-0025 163.792750 173.040250 i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you don't quite want to be their equal
sw2050B-ms98-a-0026 173.040250 183.891500 and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to w[alk]- park pretty [laughter-far] away from
sw2050B-ms98-a-0027 183.891500 185.005875 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0028 185.005875 192.441750 yes and you wouldn't want to have to walk uh you know in high heels it's hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large
sw2050B-ms98-a-0029 192.441750 196.403250 so i preferred slacks and um you know
sw2050B-ms98-a-0030 196.403250 198.783625 kind of dressy shirts and things but
sw2050B-ms98-a-0031 198.783625 207.996875 so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and
sw2050B-ms98-a-0032 207.996875 209.004625 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0033 209.004625 212.112000 didn't make me have um to much trouble and
sw2050B-ms98-a-0034 212.112000 214.864500 [noise] with the students
sw2050B-ms98-a-0035 214.864500 222.424500 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0036 222.424500 223.878000 um-hum
sw2050B-ms98-a-0037 223.878000 238.333750 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0038 238.333750 252.150500 well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh i'm not and that you don't have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to
sw2050B-ms98-a-0039 252.150500 257.773500 totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and
sw2050B-ms98-a-0040 257.773500 259.070125 and
sw2050B-ms98-a-0041 259.070125 268.047875 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0042 268.047875 276.056500 no and you don't um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater
sw2050B-ms98-a-0043 276.056500 281.377875 or something rather than having the whole entire different [laughter-wardrobe] with
sw2050B-ms98-a-0044 281.377875 284.535000 different shoes you know we always had like um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0045 284.535000 286.119375 higher
sw2050B-ms98-a-0046 286.119375 291.260250 higher shoes higher tops on them_1 rather than just um the lower
sw2050B-ms98-a-0047 291.260250 295.540500 skimm[ers]- skimmers i think they call them_1 that you would wear day-to-day but
sw2050B-ms98-a-0048 295.540500 311.400250 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0049 311.400250 312.729500 um-hum
sw2050B-ms98-a-0050 312.729500 323.361500 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0051 323.361500 326.100250 that's really true a lot of it is um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0052 326.100250 330.138625 the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable
sw2050B-ms98-a-0053 330.138625 335.521375 you know if you wear um pastels it's needs to be warm weather [laughter]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0054 335.521375 340.002875 and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and
sw2050B-ms98-a-0055 340.002875 342.435750 i guess part of that is um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0056 342.435750 350.755500 just the physics of it that in what isn't it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so 
sw2050B-ms98-a-0057 350.755500 365.268125 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0058 365.268125 366.498500 [laughter]

sw2050B-ms98-a-0062 375.848500 383.153125 that's true there's some rule that's like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day
sw2050B-ms98-a-0063 383.153125 385.512125 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0064 385.512125 394.852125 uh-huh right and the one that's like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we don't have an opportunity my husband and i we don't go to a lot of like where you have to wear
sw2050B-ms98-a-0065 394.852125 402.662625 a white dinner jacket or [laughter-something] [laughter-and] so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two
sw2050B-ms98-a-0066 402.662625 408.710375 holidays too that's pretty funny it's funny that we have as a society
sw2050B-ms98-a-0067 408.710375 413.839250 go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about [laughter]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0068 413.839250 417.126125 [silence]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0069 417.126125 418.749500 um-hum

sw2050B-ms98-a-0072 422.110125 430.466750 i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i don't know where you are but um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0073 430.466750 435.348250 oh you do that there there is a pretty um
sw2050B-ms98-a-0074 435.348250 446.709375 i wouldn't say snobbish [laughter] but it it's kind of borders on that that if i depending on what i'm wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since 
sw2050B-ms98-a-0075 446.709375 452.984875 uh where you know from where i've lived in Houston that you have to in order to get
sw2050B-ms98-a-0076 452.984875 456.102125 the attention you might need help
sw2050B-ms98-a-0077 456.102125 462.082000 you need to be you can't just come in off the street is what i'm trying to say [laughter]
sw2050B-ms98-a-0078 462.082000 463.404250 [silence]

sw2050B-ms98-a-0086 497.360875 500.549750 i think um it's kind of sad when you have to
sw2050B-ms98-a-0087 500.549750 505.918125 go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop
sw2050B-ms98-a-0088 505.918125 507.144875 [laughter]
