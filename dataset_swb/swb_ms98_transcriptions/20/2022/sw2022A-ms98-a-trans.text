sw2022A-ms98-a-0002 0.816750 7.773125 okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a
sw2022A-ms98-a-0003 7.773125 19.043000 computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month
sw2022A-ms98-a-0004 19.043000 26.218750 and then basically since then what i've done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on
sw2022A-ms98-a-0005 26.218750 34.879125 whatever we've got coming in check coming in and how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also sp[end]-
sw2022A-ms98-a-0006 34.879125 46.290500 and because_1 our house payment is once a month that's our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though it's really still there
sw2022A-ms98-a-0007 46.290500 53.668500 so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do y'all do
