sw2006B-ms98-a-0002 0.677125 11.320000 {alrighty} uh i guess our topic today is air pollution and we are to just discuss what substances do you think contribute most to air pollution
sw2006B-ms98-a-0003 11.320000 16.840000 as well as what society can do to improve the air quality of the atmosphere around us
sw2006B-ms98-a-0004 16.840000 18.301375 um
sw2006B-ms98-a-0005 18.301375 19.170875 [noise]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0006 19.170875 24.515250 does your work entitle uh anything in environmental along these lines
sw2006B-ms98-a-0007 24.515250 34.005375 [silence]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0008 34.005375 35.303750 um-hum

sw2006B-ms98-a-0010 66.544500 67.961625 very
sw2006B-ms98-a-0011 67.961625 90.148375 [silence]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0012 90.148375 100.098250 yeah it's uh having uh uh w[ell]- well i work in too i work in environmentals uh projects right now and so the Sherman deal is uh uh uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0013 100.098250 113.193625 [laughter] lost a lot of hair over that project uh what we run into um is we have the Texas Air Control Board TACB that send out uh jurisdictions under which we have to uh uh reply to
sw2006B-ms98-a-0014 113.193625 125.592625 and a lot of their rules and regulations aren't real clear so we have our manager of environmental who assist the TACB which is located in Austin in writing and hey look what we've done here at TI
sw2006B-ms98-a-0015 125.592625 132.176625 and uh we are presently uh in receipt of a site permit which will allow us to um
sw2006B-ms98-a-0016 132.176625 140.673125 uh this is air side a[llow]- allow to have certain emissions up to a certain tonnage it's in in in tons per year um
sw2006B-ms98-a-0017 140.673125 149.703250 and so w[hat]- w[hat]- you know what we do to make contributions so that basically we go and do things like put in uh high-tech scrubber systems
sw2006B-ms98-a-0018 149.703250 157.896625 uh that uh scrub out the NOX and uh VOCs and and the ammonia compounds uh li[ke]- all the acids
sw2006B-ms98-a-0019 157.896625 171.347250 uh to a certain level we are very um uh aware of the opacity which is the thickness of a stack emissions so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or there abouts
sw2006B-ms98-a-0020 171.347250 183.827250 and so what we go through is uh if you see it smoking there's a problem and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely uh it becomes a real issue especially when it's smoking and you have to get it fixed el pronto
sw2006B-ms98-a-0021 183.827250 195.823125 as you know the they're allowed to come on site the {federaldes} anytime they want drive through and see and inspect so it's a full time uh everybody has your home phone number type of job uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0022 195.823125 198.003375 [silence]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0023 198.003375 201.723125 the Sherman facility we are still in the
sw2006B-ms98-a-0024 201.723125 214.151875 closer to but still have a little bit of um finalization to do right it's been pitched to the Sherman uh City Council with uh open arms as well as the public we had open forum and and uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0025 214.151875 218.031000 uh Tom Jones our environmental corporate environmental guy's handling the project
sw2006B-ms98-a-0026 218.031000 224.679625 and uh it's real uh going real well i think it's matter just a matter of fund the funds right now as i understand it
sw2006B-ms98-a-0027 224.679625 233.345500 uh but it's uh it's something else yeah tha[t]- they're in the same issue we were uh hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0028 233.345500 243.224000 because the the system is setup where it won't have any emissions uh you're correct it will have something coming out of the stack obviously just because human nature but it won't have uh any uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0029 243.224000 253.806375 any bad stuff so uh i think TI we spend o[f]- o[f]- of all the major semiconductor firms we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost foremost uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0030 253.806375 264.327625 uh first thing we always look at and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the systems than any other firm i know of we eat and sleep the stuff everything we do over here and uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0031 264.327625 267.149500 it's an interesting job but um
sw2006B-ms98-a-0032 267.149500 314.425750 [silence]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0033 314.425750 315.844250 possibly
sw2006B-ms98-a-0034 315.844250 317.049000 hm
sw2006B-ms98-a-0035 317.049000 321.115000 [silence]
sw2006B-ms98-a-0036 321.115000 323.552375 uh i'm familiar with that one
sw2006B-ms98-a-0037 323.552375 327.523375 we uh we have stuff that's very interesting yeah
sw2006B-ms98-a-0038 327.523375 340.385625 we have hoods we have ductwork and all those type of uh interesting pieces of equipment where they have uh that we sample and it may have uh over uh a certain emission levels this is on the solid side and so we take it
sw2006B-ms98-a-0039 340.385625 351.774500 and uh we can't deep well inject something like that because it's a solid and we mix it with concrete and actually um potash per se and and concrete and then actually put it in the ground
sw2006B-ms98-a-0040 351.774500 358.343750 but not so not in a hazardous waste location because it's basically a concrete slab
sw2006B-ms98-a-0041 358.343750 370.847125 which is totally legal but the cost of doing this is astronomical they actually shave up ductwork and things and so we're uh very very uh {cognizitive} and aware of all these type of uh
sw2006B-ms98-a-0042 370.847125 384.842625 expenditures because_1 it can get very expensive but i think we you know we do all kinds of things to make the the the world a better place to live and i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that i really would 
sw2006B-ms98-a-0043 384.842625 385.880000 um
