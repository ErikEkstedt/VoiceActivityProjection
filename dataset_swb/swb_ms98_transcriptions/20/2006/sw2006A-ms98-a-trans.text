sw2006A-ms98-a-0004 26.010875 34.825125 me i'm in the legal department and um we do have uh a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues
sw2006A-ms98-a-0005 34.825125 47.291625 and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing i do know for other types of uh pollution like the toxic waste and such that TI has to dispose of the we normally put in the ground you know we're coming up with a
sw2006A-ms98-a-0006 47.291625 60.269750 a new solution we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump and we just transport to these places but after while it always seems that the um oh the site starts to leak and then you have to clean it up and such
sw2006A-ms98-a-0007 60.269750 73.063125 but the new idea is to take everything up to Sherman and we're gonna have that you know incineration place up there and dump everything there and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants
sw2006A-ms98-a-0008 73.063125 82.592875 from what i've heard that everything would be in in you know a confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up and that we won't be polluting the air i'm sure we have to have
sw2006A-ms98-a-0009 82.592875 90.505500 uh permits you know for that place and that there's you know limits as to what we can uh let you know go into the air

sw2006A-ms98-a-0041 266.482375 273.270875 well i know from some of the sites that we've had done quite a list of sites that have gone bad and you have to clean up and
sw2006A-ms98-a-0042 273.270875 282.058750 you know the law now is a super fund and anybody who's contributed toxic waste no matter if you were somebody that eventually you know uh damaged the ground or not
sw2006A-ms98-a-0043 282.058750 291.780875 uh everybody has to contribute and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh gotten pulled into these uh super fund deals to clean it up that's you know mega bucks to uh
sw2006A-ms98-a-0044 291.780875 298.094000 you know take everything out and redo it and you know fill in some other area and um
sw2006A-ms98-a-0045 298.094000 311.875250 certainly it would seem to have a better solution like the Sherman facility than um just letting it go in the ground because_1 eventually you know i[t]- it seems that no matter what they do if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined uh dump area
sw2006A-ms98-a-0046 311.875250 315.169625 it still only in time starts to leak out
sw2006A-ms98-a-0047 315.169625 320.189375 yeah there there was one site that they cleaned up and then the new place leaked again
