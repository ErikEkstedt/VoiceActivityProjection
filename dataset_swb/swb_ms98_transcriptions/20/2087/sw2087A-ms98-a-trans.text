sw2087A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 8.325625 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0002 8.325625 14.113750 that's right uh i think so i had a sister who is in the Peace Corps as a matter of fact
sw2087A-ms98-a-0003 14.113750 19.378125 uh back when it was uh [vocalized-noise] a Kennedy thing uh sixty
sw2087A-ms98-a-0004 19.378125 22.308875 uh seven and eight
sw2087A-ms98-a-0005 22.308875 36.042125 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0006 36.042125 37.427375 uh-huh
sw2087A-ms98-a-0007 37.427375 39.355875 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0008 39.355875 42.103375 well i feel like if it were
sw2087A-ms98-a-0009 42.103375 50.753500 [noise] if [vocalized-noise] if everyone had an equivalent requirement [noise] such that it were inescapable and i think that
sw2087A-ms98-a-0010 50.753500 64.447375 that that would be important for me that that there wasn't that it was optional that if if every person and i could pick a time i guess rather than worrying about whether it was one years or two years suppose it were to be uh eighteen months
sw2087A-ms98-a-0011 64.447375 77.631125 uh if every citizen were required to participate in public service and could choose from a sort of a menu of what jobs would might be available at any given time
sw2087A-ms98-a-0012 77.631125 82.621750 and could not get out of that no matter what short of dysfunctional handicap
sw2087A-ms98-a-0013 82.621750 93.195125 you know that the person were just unable to participate i guess i would not be against that as a requirement i i'm not sure the country needs it but i don't know that i would be against it and it
sw2087A-ms98-a-0014 93.195125 97.827625 it seems to be it would be important that nobody could c[ould]- c[ould]- to opt out
sw2087A-ms98-a-0015 97.827625 124.032250 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0016 124.032250 137.338875 it seems that you could have a menu where depending on the needs for jobs you could reward them differently and then let people compete for them if you you know i could envision somebody saying by the time you were
sw2087A-ms98-a-0017 137.338875 151.502750 twenty five or pick some clock age that that would say you would have to give a certain number of years and you could you could say well i i could go in the army i could go in the navy i could go into civil service i could be a forest ranger a hospital attendant or whatever and 
sw2087A-ms98-a-0018 151.502750 155.808000 and i guess some jobs that might be higher risk you might want to compensate
sw2087A-ms98-a-0019 155.808000 159.450000 with some reward that was higher which would
sw2087A-ms98-a-0020 159.450000 161.343000 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0021 161.343000 163.357750 oh yeah that's interesting
sw2087A-ms98-a-0022 163.357750 169.942500 uh like you can go go in the army for eighteen months or you can be a forest ranger for two years or something [laughter]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0023 169.942500 177.089250 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0024 177.089250 178.658375 uh-huh
sw2087A-ms98-a-0025 178.658375 183.402625 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0026 183.402625 187.349875 how do you feel about whether it's necessary or not it if
sw2087A-ms98-a-0027 187.349875 199.299750 uh it it seems like we tend to be seem to be focused in on as long as it were equal and equitable it would be okay but uh how do you feel about whether it's something that the country needs or what the benefits would be
sw2087A-ms98-a-0028 199.299750 228.171125 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0029 228.171125 229.631125 um-hum
sw2087A-ms98-a-0030 229.631125 231.468375 so you're say[ing]-
sw2087A-ms98-a-0031 231.468375 242.066625 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0032 242.066625 243.554625 uh-huh
sw2087A-ms98-a-0033 243.554625 249.133250 yeah it seems to me like there's a lot of infrastructure problems that we're accumulating in the United States that
sw2087A-ms98-a-0034 249.133250 260.714500 uh we could address with with manpower everything from like well like national parks began to be in a state of decline because we can't fund their repair and some of them were built in a period during the depression when
sw2087A-ms98-a-0035 260.714500 270.117500 there were deliberate programs put in place to get people occupied and so we put millions and millions of person hours into developing some of the parks systems and we can't afford to keep up
sw2087A-ms98-a-0036 270.117500 278.756000 and we probably in order to return them to a state of a usefulness we'd have to invest those same person hours but we couldn't pay regular wages and
sw2087A-ms98-a-0037 278.756000 288.250750 uh i guess it wouldn't bother me if the wages were barely scale or subscale if it were a sacrifice that everyone made
sw2087A-ms98-a-0038 288.250750 295.500125 [silence]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0039 295.500125 297.116250 uh-huh
sw2087A-ms98-a-0040 297.116250 298.479875 so i
sw2087A-ms98-a-0041 298.479875 309.218375 so i wouldn't i guess i wouldn't feel like there would be a required compensation as any sort of uh the army approach room board and forty bucks a month to uh spend at the P X [laughter]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0042 309.218375 313.306875 [laughter]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0043 313.306875 315.708000 [laughter]
sw2087A-ms98-a-0044 315.708000 328.809625 yeah well that would be back in the and he didn't have much more than that uh back in the sixties or so i mean it's a little more money than that but it wasn't very much it was you you didn't do much other than buy a car or maybe have enough money to send home to a wife
sw2087A-ms98-a-0045 328.809625 330.226750 uh

sw2087A-ms98-a-0049 337.367375 352.142125 i think it's good that people feel that they commit themselves to a country or to that they've if you offer of yourself you feel differently afterwards i think about the fact that you've put yourself into a country as opposed to expect everything to be given to you
sw2087A-ms98-a-0050 352.142125 355.188000 [silence]
