sw2064B-ms98-a-0023 98.248625 104.756875 somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting
sw2064B-ms98-a-0024 104.756875 110.867375 the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know
sw2064B-ms98-a-0025 110.867375 113.114125 [noise] is really kind of bad and

sw2064B-ms98-a-0037 159.257625 162.827125 do you think most states have that or

sw2064B-ms98-a-0045 193.896000 206.384875 have that well and it doesn't seem like very many people uh are really i mean there's a lot of people that are on death row but there's not very many people that actually um do get killed
sw2064B-ms98-a-0046 206.384875 207.508875 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0047 207.508875 209.027000 um-hum
sw2064B-ms98-a-0048 209.027000 212.483125 [noise] so seems like a lot of people live there and then
sw2064B-ms98-a-0049 212.483125 219.644875 through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper
sw2064B-ms98-a-0050 219.644875 222.365375 if it finally gets to that point
sw2064B-ms98-a-0051 222.365375 227.638250 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0052 227.638250 228.861625 yeah

sw2064B-ms98-a-0059 251.631875 255.427250 so it's a little bit more humane i guess it is
sw2064B-ms98-a-0060 255.427250 259.370000 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0061 259.370000 260.601750 [laughter]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0062 260.601750 263.677125 yes the other one just seems so terrible
sw2064B-ms98-a-0063 263.677125 265.687750 hum
sw2064B-ms98-a-0064 265.687750 276.126125 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0065 276.126125 284.973875 well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison
sw2064B-ms98-a-0066 284.973875 286.454250 um-hum
sw2064B-ms98-a-0067 286.454250 292.714500 [silence]

sw2064B-ms98-a-0073 307.154125 312.883125 well um i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area [noise] it's
sw2064B-ms98-a-0074 312.883125 314.489875 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0075 314.489875 317.734625 and it's kind of been scary to think about it and
sw2064B-ms98-a-0076 317.734625 321.873875 you're hoping there is something that will cut down on that
sw2064B-ms98-a-0077 321.873875 323.827750 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0078 323.827750 326.841875 you hate to have the dubious honor of being
sw2064B-ms98-a-0079 326.841875 328.955125 you know so high in the
sw2064B-ms98-a-0080 328.955125 330.660000 in statistics
sw2064B-ms98-a-0081 330.660000 331.899000 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0082 331.899000 335.621125 but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasn't had [noise]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0083 335.621125 336.927500 any crime
sw2064B-ms98-a-0084 336.927500 339.028250 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0085 339.028250 341.203000 and so we don't
sw2064B-ms98-a-0086 341.203000 345.615750 it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way
sw2064B-ms98-a-0087 345.615750 348.533375 and how they would expect how they would
sw2064B-ms98-a-0088 348.533375 357.250750 hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they can't just stop it
sw2064B-ms98-a-0089 357.250750 358.265375 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0090 358.265375 360.097750 so maybe you would
sw2064B-ms98-a-0091 360.097750 364.413000 but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
sw2064B-ms98-a-0092 364.413000 367.988875 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0093 367.988875 374.274875 no [laughter] i know when um we just we moved here um i from the
sw2064B-ms98-a-0094 374.274875 378.156250 i got a summons jury summons just
sw2064B-ms98-a-0095 378.156250 387.807000 like [laughter-constantly] it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didn't have to go and it's not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury it's just that
sw2064B-ms98-a-0096 387.807000 392.196375 i didn't i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life
sw2064B-ms98-a-0097 392.196375 394.186250 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0098 394.186250 401.282000 and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything
sw2064B-ms98-a-0099 401.282000 403.052500 that would be really awful
sw2064B-ms98-a-0100 403.052500 404.518250 [silence]
sw2064B-ms98-a-0101 404.518250 411.078750 well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh [laughter] talking about this although it has been difficult but uh
sw2064B-ms98-a-0102 411.078750 414.652500 i'd hate to decide it but i guess um
sw2064B-ms98-a-0103 414.652500 419.587375 guess it's important that we decide as a people what what we're going to do
sw2064B-ms98-a-0104 419.587375 421.955750 anyway well you have a good day
sw2064B-ms98-a-0105 421.955750 424.193750 thank you bye-bye
