sw2060A-ms98-a-0010 31.684875 37.601625 it was unusual not to have the different sources you know of news coverage

sw2060A-ms98-a-0015 71.004875 76.634625 a discussion about that is why uh why CNN was
sw2060A-ms98-a-0016 76.634625 89.279375 well i listen to a Christian radio station and they were saying that CNN is definitely a world uh news service and uh
sw2060A-ms98-a-0017 89.279375 97.223875 that [vocalized-noise] was you can't really be sure of the quality of what you got you know
