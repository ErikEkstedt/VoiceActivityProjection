sw2032A-ms98-a-0015 59.276500 63.498500 we're talking about what they th[ey]- they call hard rock
sw2032A-ms98-a-0016 63.498500 66.151625 [silence]

sw2032A-ms98-a-0018 71.023750 72.450500 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0019 72.450500 73.721125 well
sw2032A-ms98-a-0020 73.721125 76.380500 well they're like for example AC DC
sw2032A-ms98-a-0021 76.380500 80.572750 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0022 80.572750 87.876000 why have you heard of them_1 okay and stuff like that that's that's that's not really hard rock
sw2032A-ms98-a-0023 87.876000 89.185875 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0024 89.185875 90.280625 okay
sw2032A-ms98-a-0025 90.280625 94.015500 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0026 94.015500 97.520500 well Cinderella is is hard rock heavy metal
sw2032A-ms98-a-0027 97.520500 102.237875 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0028 102.237875 110.010125 but see for example they have see what what other bands consider it like really hard rock it's like brash metal
sw2032A-ms98-a-0029 110.010125 116.282250 which all they do is they have like this guitar and they just bang at the guitar and the guitar is set like really low 
sw2032A-ms98-a-0030 116.282250 117.838625 [noise]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0031 117.838625 127.474625 and what happens is ah everybody gets like totally into the music and then they start dancing around and they just bump into each other
sw2032A-ms98-a-0032 127.474625 130.805875 like like they hit each other with their shoulders
sw2032A-ms98-a-0033 130.805875 138.630500 and then you knock people down and what you do is you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people
sw2032A-ms98-a-0034 138.630500 140.195250 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0035 140.195250 142.602500 no i don't like that music
sw2032A-ms98-a-0036 142.602500 152.289000 but that's that's what they do that's that's what some people call like really heavy metal and see the difference i guess between hard rock and heavy metal is that the lyrics also
sw2032A-ms98-a-0037 152.289000 161.867625 like really like heavy metal [vocalized-noise] considered like the words heavy metal and like they always talk about like suicide and killing people and stuff like that
sw2032A-ms98-a-0038 161.867625 162.683250 [noise]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0039 162.683250 170.426750 and just hard rock has th[ey]- they don't talk about that they just talk about like life in general like Queen's Reich if you ever heard of them_1
sw2032A-ms98-a-0040 170.426750 171.697250 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0041 171.697250 173.398875 so
sw2032A-ms98-a-0042 173.398875 174.438375 [silence]

sw2032A-ms98-a-0048 195.830875 201.983125 Bo[hemian]- Bo[hemian]- Bohemian Rhapsody yeah that that was great i heard that the other day on the radio and i pumped it up
sw2032A-ms98-a-0049 201.983125 204.791250 because i mean i just love that song
sw2032A-ms98-a-0050 204.791250 206.371875 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0051 206.371875 209.967750 yeah but they had th[at]- that that whole record was pretty good
sw2032A-ms98-a-0052 209.967750 213.191750 but then they started going downhill like everybody else
sw2032A-ms98-a-0053 213.191750 216.171500 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0054 216.171500 221.330625 yeah they they're still around they got a new a new CD out but i d[on't]- i wouldn't buy it
sw2032A-ms98-a-0055 221.330625 227.706125 because see what happens is the oldies see what i like i like the old Rolling Stones i don't like the new stuff
sw2032A-ms98-a-0056 227.706125 228.860750 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0057 228.860750 230.056875 yeah
sw2032A-ms98-a-0058 230.056875 238.788875 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0059 238.788875 240.073375 yeah
sw2032A-ms98-a-0060 240.073375 251.504625 yeah well for example i used to like the old Phil Collins an old Genesis and and then what happened was that Phil Collins said hey i can make money a lot of money doing this
sw2032A-ms98-a-0061 251.504625 256.692250 and then he came out with uh see for example his his record like No Jacket Required
sw2032A-ms98-a-0062 256.692250 267.817875 that was good but it was on it's way of going downhill because he said i can make a lot of money just singing alone and then he came out with the Invisible Touch with uh Genesis
sw2032A-ms98-a-0063 267.817875 273.701875 and that really like now i hate Phil Collins i can't stand him because i look at him and i say
sw2032A-ms98-a-0064 273.701875 284.393750 you know you were singing at this time and with these people and you were great and now you're singing all this stuff that doesn't matter what you what you sing or what you record it's still going to be a number one hit
sw2032A-ms98-a-0065 284.393750 287.599000 and so that's that's what gets me mad
sw2032A-ms98-a-0066 287.599000 288.603625 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0067 288.603625 291.221375 but did did you go see that new Doors movie
sw2032A-ms98-a-0068 291.221375 294.896000 [silence]
sw2032A-ms98-a-0069 294.896000 297.108250 yeah i saw it when it opened
sw2032A-ms98-a-0070 297.108250 305.311250 yeah well i[t]- it's it's uh you know it's like i was watching Siskel and Ebert you know like those guys that criticize movies
sw2032A-ms98-a-0071 305.311250 315.098125 and they both loved the movie right they said the music's great it took me back to the sixties and stuff like that and then one of them_1 said well everything is great but i'm gonna give it a thumbs down
sw2032A-ms98-a-0072 315.098125 319.547750 and they go but why because it's like the end is like really depressing
sw2032A-ms98-a-0073 319.547750 329.502000 and so an[d]- but but it's like but it's like the movie is so well made and the music that goes with it just picks you up see i was never i was born in nineteen hundred sixty nine 
sw2032A-ms98-a-0074 329.502000 339.896625 so i mean so for me no but you learn to i mean it's just that like the the sixties music's got a lot to say
sw2032A-ms98-a-0075 339.896625 346.090000 i i never found out the a lot of the seventies music had too [laughter] you know i was like [laughter]

sw2032A-ms98-a-0091 392.894625 396.725500 well they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in
sw2032A-ms98-a-0092 396.725500 400.326875 in progression ever in history
sw2032A-ms98-a-0093 400.326875 403.237750 so naw about everything
sw2032A-ms98-a-0094 403.237750 410.503875 so it's like nothing happened during the seventies everything happened during the sixties the seventies i don't know what they're called you know it's like
sw2032A-ms98-a-0095 410.503875 416.798125 like the the eighties are called like the progressive years or the or or you know like the technology years
