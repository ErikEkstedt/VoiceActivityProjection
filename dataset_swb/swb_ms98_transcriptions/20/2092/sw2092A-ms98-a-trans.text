sw2092A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.409500 [noise]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0002 0.409500 6.593750 well the thing is is that uh since i'm in school i don't like basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad
sw2092A-ms98-a-0003 6.593750 7.071375 [noise]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0004 7.071375 16.805250 but the thing is is that um i have to keep it under control because for example you know it's like [vocalized-noise] the the beginning of the semester when you g[o]- have to pay for everything
sw2092A-ms98-a-0005 16.805250 26.636750 everything's pretty rough but he controls that part but then whenever you know it's like once the semester start i'm the one who has to control how much spending there is
sw2092A-ms98-a-0006 26.636750 33.939500 and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food and uh so
sw2092A-ms98-a-0007 33.939500 36.544125 well the thing is is that i live in a dorm
sw2092A-ms98-a-0008 36.544125 45.370875 so uh what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts and the the tuition is also the same thing
sw2092A-ms98-a-0009 45.370875 51.966375 so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and that's about it
sw2092A-ms98-a-0010 51.966375 66.839125 but the thing uh also is that you know like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars uh you know three times a week
sw2092A-ms98-a-0011 66.839125 77.172500 so i mean it's for for us you know it's like i- i can spend i can spend that money but it's not it's not what i want to spend it on you know
sw2092A-ms98-a-0012 77.172500 78.717625 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0013 78.717625 85.248000 no because um they don't allow me to work since uh i'm a foreign student
sw2092A-ms98-a-0014 85.248000 89.367250 and so they the government doesn't allow me to work
sw2092A-ms98-a-0015 89.367250 91.124375 uh-huh
sw2092A-ms98-a-0016 91.124375 96.189375 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0017 96.189375 100.601250 well the thing is is that um i ba[sically]- i basically know how much i have right
sw2092A-ms98-a-0018 100.601250 103.034875 and so the thing is is that
sw2092A-ms98-a-0019 103.034875 107.158000 i i can tell like uh i get all my money out of the teller
sw2092A-ms98-a-0020 107.158000 113.185500 and besides see o[ne]- one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call you know international
sw2092A-ms98-a-0021 113.185500 116.125000 Argentina yeah
sw2092A-ms98-a-0022 116.125000 121.084875 and so the bas[ic]- one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills
sw2092A-ms98-a-0023 121.084875 134.238875 well that's they w[ant]- they want me to call down there every so often i me[an]- i told my dad li[sten]- dad listen if you want to save money i won't call so often you know he goes we want to keep in touch so it doesn't matter about the money because_1 we need to hear from you
sw2092A-ms98-a-0024 134.238875 143.753625 no because it's more expensive that way uh any any uh basically the United States is the cheapest country to call out of
sw2092A-ms98-a-0025 143.753625 147.550625 and uh because it's considered luxury in other countries
sw2092A-ms98-a-0026 147.550625 148.946750 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0027 148.946750 152.372125 right since it's his money anyway you know
sw2092A-ms98-a-0028 152.372125 154.065375 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0029 154.065375 156.905625 no uh i got money to pay that too
sw2092A-ms98-a-0030 156.905625 168.867375 so it's basically you know it's like it's not too much money and it's not too little money so i won't have to you know rush a letter to him or something because uh he really wants me to concentrate on my studies
sw2092A-ms98-a-0031 168.867375 169.937125 [silence]

sw2092A-ms98-a-0059 272.679625 276.723375 well then uh see uh that's that's one of the points which i don't
sw2092A-ms98-a-0060 276.723375 287.687500 see like i i don't give a lot of gifts during Christmas and i you know i don't wa[nt]- i don't like to give any at all because the thing is is that you know it's like if i want something i'll i'll ask somebody you know like
sw2092A-ms98-a-0061 287.687500 293.210000 like m[y]- uh for Ch[ristmas]- for Christmas you know my roommate goes what do you want and i said i want a backpack
sw2092A-ms98-a-0062 293.210000 297.472750 you know uh no i told him you if you want to give me a present for Christmas give me a backpack
sw2092A-ms98-a-0063 297.472750 307.217875 right because i i needed a backpack so he gave me a backpack and i i knew he needed an alarm clock so i bought him an alarm clock so the thing was that that
sw2092A-ms98-a-0064 307.217875 310.107750 right but
sw2092A-ms98-a-0065 310.107750 322.805875 right but uh thing is especially i mean when i was down Argentina it was to me was ridiculous because you know you have to once a year you go out and you spend all this money on all these people and some you don't care about you know it's like
sw2092A-ms98-a-0066 322.805875 326.236250 yeah and so but the thing is is that um
sw2092A-ms98-a-0067 326.236250 331.467375 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0068 331.467375 332.790000 yeah
sw2092A-ms98-a-0069 332.790000 337.476250 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0070 337.476250 339.800750 yeah yeah
sw2092A-ms98-a-0071 339.800750 342.239125 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0072 342.239125 350.116750 well for example we had spring break now and i went skiing and i spent around like maybe two hundred dollars or
sw2092A-ms98-a-0073 350.116750 353.563625 so uh but you know its like uh
sw2092A-ms98-a-0074 353.563625 355.563250 [silence]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0075 355.563250 365.380750 yeah yeah because it's like you know say you know it's like we're saying let's go eat out before spring break i go let's not go eat out before spring break let's see how much money we have afterwards
sw2092A-ms98-a-0076 365.380750 370.530375 and if i felt like i spent way too much then uh i won't go out you know
sw2092A-ms98-a-0077 370.530375 375.965375 and so like my roommate went home i went skiing in uh over the Carolina Mountains which aren't anything
sw2092A-ms98-a-0078 375.965375 376.257375 [noise]
sw2092A-ms98-a-0079 376.257375 377.554875 but um
sw2092A-ms98-a-0080 377.554875 381.952375 but it was you know it was i guess it was worth it you know it was a nice place
sw2092A-ms98-a-0081 381.952375 383.951625 yeah yeah
sw2092A-ms98-a-0082 383.951625 388.277625 yeah especially if you live on campus and you don't have a car you just go crazy
sw2092A-ms98-a-0083 388.277625 395.061500 so oh well let's see how long have we been talking here six minutes and a half okay yeah
sw2092A-ms98-a-0084 395.061500 398.466375 all right well nice talking to you all right bye-bye
