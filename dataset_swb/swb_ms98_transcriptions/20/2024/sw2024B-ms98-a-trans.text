sw2024B-ms98-a-0024 139.467750 144.386000 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0025 144.386000 146.098000 [noise] um [noise]

sw2024B-ms98-a-0028 148.920500 159.291875 we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was
sw2024B-ms98-a-0029 159.291875 173.051875 [noise] At America's Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments
sw2024B-ms98-a-0030 173.051875 179.741625 um one of it's great slogans is if you're not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is
sw2024B-ms98-a-0031 179.741625 191.547750 [noise] uh so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i'm your customer sort of thing um
sw2024B-ms98-a-0032 191.547750 201.317750 every now and then i'm loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh
sw2024B-ms98-a-0033 201.317750 209.927125 better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type

sw2024B-ms98-a-0038 223.442750 226.155625 [laughter] like what for example
sw2024B-ms98-a-0039 226.155625 247.510125 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0040 247.510125 248.769750 um-hum

sw2024B-ms98-a-0043 258.537750 260.199250 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0044 260.199250 268.809875 sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um
sw2024B-ms98-a-0045 268.809875 275.370125 our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know
sw2024B-ms98-a-0046 275.370125 285.030500 by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and it's a very layman's uh uh approach towards managing different types of people
sw2024B-ms98-a-0047 285.030500 291.651250 and the very last chapter and i haven't figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers [laughter]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0048 291.651250 301.731125 so it's it's ver[y]- it's interesting here again it's it's casual reading and it's not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it's really uh excellent fast reading and uh
sw2024B-ms98-a-0049 301.731125 311.876375 but as you say it's it's sometimes it's difficult to to know if it's you know i think if somebody wants to say -[o]kay read these ten books because_1 these are self-improvements i would probably be turned off to them_1
sw2024B-ms98-a-0050 311.876375 320.474625 he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them_1 it might be a little more interesting [laughter]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0051 320.474625 326.123250 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0052 326.123250 333.967250 yeah they're uh quite uh they're hard to set down because it's so interesting and course they're always a little spookier than the movies but uh
sw2024B-ms98-a-0053 333.967250 339.207500 it's always they're always challenging to get through one of them_1 i have a hard time finishing books
sw2024B-ms98-a-0054 339.207500 350.799875 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0055 350.799875 352.251250 um-hum
sw2024B-ms98-a-0056 352.251250 359.970625 in quality -[es]pecially nowadays uh that's almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of th[e]-
sw2024B-ms98-a-0057 359.970625 362.984875 [silence]

sw2024B-ms98-a-0060 367.547125 380.314500 [noise] yeah w[e]- we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don't fully understand what wh[at]- what it is we're saying i think it's it's focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh
sw2024B-ms98-a-0061 380.314500 382.142750 that's kind of part of it
sw2024B-ms98-a-0062 382.142750 385.907875 [silence]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0063 385.907875 394.349250 uh not that i can think of um i think i'm under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two [laughter]
sw2024B-ms98-a-0064 394.349250 397.358750 ah this is true i've enjoyed it
