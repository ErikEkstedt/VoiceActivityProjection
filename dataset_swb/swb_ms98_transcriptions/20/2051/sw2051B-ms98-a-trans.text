sw2051B-ms98-a-0010 22.647750 27.255375 yeah that's kind of ironic because i don't live too far from Oklahoma either
sw2051B-ms98-a-0011 27.255375 29.721625 you know where Saint Joe is
sw2051B-ms98-a-0012 29.721625 31.814875 [silence]

sw2051B-ms98-a-0017 50.358125 53.914125 i've i've seen those statistics and everything
sw2051B-ms98-a-0018 53.914125 55.952750 and you know what frightens me
sw2051B-ms98-a-0019 55.952750 60.394000 is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert
sw2051B-ms98-a-0020 60.394000 62.964000 with high tech weaponry
sw2051B-ms98-a-0021 62.964000 63.979000 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0022 63.979000 65.360000 you know i mean
sw2051B-ms98-a-0023 65.360000 71.650875 the Iraqis didn't have a lot of high-tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that
sw2051B-ms98-a-0024 71.650875 74.309125 and they didn't kill as many people in
sw2051B-ms98-a-0025 74.309125 76.874875 in forty five days
sw2051B-ms98-a-0026 76.874875 80.337125 and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job
sw2051B-ms98-a-0027 80.337125 83.152250 as they killed in Washington DC
sw2051B-ms98-a-0028 83.152250 94.866875 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0029 94.866875 96.069500 well
sw2051B-ms98-a-0030 96.069500 99.447625 i formulated a pretty radical theory
sw2051B-ms98-a-0031 99.447625 103.373375 over the last ten years i guess
sw2051B-ms98-a-0032 103.373375 104.739625 and
sw2051B-ms98-a-0033 104.739625 106.895125 i've come to the conclusion
sw2051B-ms98-a-0034 106.895125 107.908250 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0035 107.908250 109.242125 and this is [vocalized-noise]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0036 109.242125 110.366500 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0037 110.366500 112.842000 a pretty scary thought to me even
sw2051B-ms98-a-0038 112.842000 117.286125 that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime
sw2051B-ms98-a-0039 117.286125 121.384000 rather than put them in prison because_1 prison's proven not to work
sw2051B-ms98-a-0040 121.384000 122.760250 just let them_1 go
sw2051B-ms98-a-0041 122.760250 124.021250 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0042 124.021250 126.114375 say okay you're convicted
sw2051B-ms98-a-0043 126.114375 128.328875 and just let them_1 go
sw2051B-ms98-a-0044 128.328875 131.016000 and if they get convicted again
sw2051B-ms98-a-0045 131.016000 132.287750 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0046 132.287750 133.768875 well just kill them_1
sw2051B-ms98-a-0047 133.768875 139.375500 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0048 139.375500 141.820750 well i think that
sw2051B-ms98-a-0049 141.820750 144.055125 the best hope
sw2051B-ms98-a-0050 144.055125 145.860750 to eliminate
sw2051B-ms98-a-0051 145.860750 147.223250 crime
sw2051B-ms98-a-0052 147.223250 149.156750 as we know it today
sw2051B-ms98-a-0053 149.156750 151.855625 is to eliminate the criminals from society
sw2051B-ms98-a-0054 151.855625 152.914500 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0055 152.914500 157.323375 if someone is known to have been in prison they can't get a job
sw2051B-ms98-a-0056 157.323375 161.656375 you know they can't be accepted into society
sw2051B-ms98-a-0057 161.656375 166.694125 you know if they're not going to be accepted into society then everybody's going to become sociopathic

sw2051B-ms98-a-0059 167.696125 171.659250 and you know who's to put the limit on it
sw2051B-ms98-a-0060 171.659250 176.035375 i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State
sw2051B-ms98-a-0061 176.035375 178.486750 if you get convicted of uh
sw2051B-ms98-a-0062 178.486750 179.530250 [silence]

sw2051B-ms98-a-0066 187.183125 190.933000 and they're still let out on the street after one or two years
sw2051B-ms98-a-0067 190.933000 195.528750 well in Washington State if you're a habitual sexual offender
sw2051B-ms98-a-0068 195.528750 196.549875 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0069 196.549875 198.112375 they just don't let you out

sw2051B-ms98-a-0072 202.024250 207.099625 and then you go into the mental hospital and if you're pronounced cured they'll let you go
sw2051B-ms98-a-0073 207.099625 208.478750 well
sw2051B-ms98-a-0074 208.478750 209.857750 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0075 209.857750 213.703875 they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now
sw2051B-ms98-a-0076 213.703875 225.082250 you know 
sw2051B-ms98-a-0077 225.082250 226.970500 hey people make mistakes

sw2051B-ms98-a-0079 234.505625 236.026000 well
sw2051B-ms98-a-0080 236.026000 245.420000 yeah use that or you know there's other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against
sw2051B-ms98-a-0081 245.420000 246.702625 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0082 246.702625 247.965000 you know
sw2051B-ms98-a-0083 247.965000 253.267250 at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against
sw2051B-ms98-a-0084 253.267250 260.160000 feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them
sw2051B-ms98-a-0085 260.160000 261.384500 [silence]
sw2051B-ms98-a-0086 261.384500 267.982250 but uh you know with the tech[nology]- technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg
sw2051B-ms98-a-0087 267.982250 271.435875 that will knock him down if they leave the property
sw2051B-ms98-a-0088 271.435875 272.574625 [silence]

sw2051B-ms98-a-0091 275.831125 278.685250 and you can put a collar around a guys leg
sw2051B-ms98-a-0092 278.685250 280.509125 that will
sw2051B-ms98-a-0093 280.509125 282.613500 prohibit them
sw2051B-ms98-a-0094 282.613500 285.040250 from committing any kind of
