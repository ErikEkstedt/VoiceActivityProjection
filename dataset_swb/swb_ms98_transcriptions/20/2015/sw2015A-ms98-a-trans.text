sw2015A-ms98-a-0003 2.152375 9.128250 have you ever got one of those calls that's either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and they're either 
sw2015A-ms98-a-0004 9.128250 12.953250 offering a service or
sw2015A-ms98-a-0005 12.953250 17.771875 they're introducing some new product in the area and
sw2015A-ms98-a-0006 17.771875 24.318875 normally when they call you're either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone
sw2015A-ms98-a-0007 24.318875 28.783250 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0008 28.783250 33.290500 that was the big one i'm talking about i work weird hours
sw2015A-ms98-a-0009 33.290500 38.725625 and invariably just about the time i'm going to sleep the phone tears off the wall
sw2015A-ms98-a-0010 38.725625 47.307500 and you're trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the cli[ck]- as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on
sw2015A-ms98-a-0011 47.307500 55.125375 or you hear somebody already starting r[eading]- reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already
sw2015A-ms98-a-0012 55.125375 63.938625 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0013 63.938625 66.840125 even had some of them_1 the
sw2015A-ms98-a-0014 66.840125 71.665375 they're voice activated and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything
sw2015A-ms98-a-0015 71.665375 83.371250 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0016 83.371250 86.945125 what i would love to see done to stop all of this
sw2015A-ms98-a-0017 86.945125 88.499250 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0018 88.499250 92.926750 we've got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted
sw2015A-ms98-a-0019 92.926750 94.268000 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0020 94.268000 100.485125 i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think it's great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything
sw2015A-ms98-a-0021 100.485125 114.700500 but if they're going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them_1
sw2015A-ms98-a-0022 114.700500 136.105750 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0023 136.105750 140.900500 that's about that as far as any other everyday occurrences
sw2015A-ms98-a-0024 140.900500 142.257500 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0025 142.257500 148.652250 i put a stop to some of them_1 as far as the door-to-door either religious groups or people
sw2015A-ms98-a-0026 148.652250 155.627250 peddling products if i wanted their products i would've either gone to the store to bought it or i would've called for their s[alesman]- salesman to come out
sw2015A-ms98-a-0027 155.627250 212.059375 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0028 212.059375 215.663375 now i agree with their right to um
sw2015A-ms98-a-0029 215.663375 216.675000 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0030 216.675000 225.984500 pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the American home whether it be in a house or in an apartment
sw2015A-ms98-a-0031 225.984500 231.619625 i'm on my turf if i want them there i'll call for them_1 otherwise i don't want to know they exist
sw2015A-ms98-a-0032 231.619625 274.422375 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0033 274.422375 284.015750 now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting i've even gone so far as to put that i've got a storm door on the front of the house and i've put in
sw2015A-ms98-a-0034 284.015750 294.453125 i don't know how much clearer it can be it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have g[uessed]- i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because_1 i still get
sw2015A-ms98-a-0035 294.453125 316.369250 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0036 316.369250 326.191250 wonder if there'd be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal it'd be harassment
sw2015A-ms98-a-0037 326.191250 329.633250 but i consider invasion of my privacy
sw2015A-ms98-a-0038 329.633250 331.783250 a harassment in itself
sw2015A-ms98-a-0039 331.783250 339.647500 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0040 339.647500 342.810250 i believe we've pretty much summed everything up
sw2015A-ms98-a-0041 342.810250 371.190625 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0042 371.190625 373.264125 i'm drawing the blank
sw2015A-ms98-a-0043 373.264125 378.547250 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0044 378.547250 381.753875 uh pretty close to it well i've enjoyed talking with you
sw2015A-ms98-a-0045 381.753875 382.827500 [silence]
sw2015A-ms98-a-0046 382.827500 385.727125 and take it easy now good night
