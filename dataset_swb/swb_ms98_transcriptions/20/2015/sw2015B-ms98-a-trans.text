sw2015B-ms98-a-0031 167.395875 181.364625 uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell him hey there's people coming around you know and they're trying to sell something or or they're from a religious organization
sw2015B-ms98-a-0032 181.364625 186.699250 [noise] and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago

sw2015B-ms98-a-0040 243.232000 257.050375 and and it's their mission as they do as they go door-to-door and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work
sw2015B-ms98-a-0041 257.050375 267.160625 and i don't know i just um i just don't particularly care for that at all and that that's one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations
sw2015B-ms98-a-0042 267.160625 274.219500 and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own
