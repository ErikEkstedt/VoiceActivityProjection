sw2096A-ms98-a-0001 0.000000 0.998125 [noise]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0002 0.998125 3.977500 do you feel that uh drug testing is necessary at the workplace
sw2096A-ms98-a-0003 3.977500 17.576125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0004 17.576125 25.780500 yeah i have some basic concerns about it as well uh not just the invasion of privacy but the the chance of uh false positive be[ing]- being reported
sw2096A-ms98-a-0005 25.780500 30.472750 uh i have been drug tested in the past and it's not really a pleasant experience at work
sw2096A-ms98-a-0006 30.472750 36.840375 and uh it gives you the uh im[pression]- [vocalized-noise] the uh impression that the company really doesn't trust the people that work for them_1
sw2096A-ms98-a-0007 36.840375 42.083000 and you're pretty much uh assumed to be guilty until proven innocent by the test results
sw2096A-ms98-a-0008 42.083000 51.296250 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0009 51.296250 52.647500 yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0010 52.647500 60.430125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0011 60.430125 67.252250 yeah well they make uh allowances for that if you report that at the time that you take the test
sw2096A-ms98-a-0012 67.252250 70.770625 but there's always a chance that you forget and have to justify it later
sw2096A-ms98-a-0013 70.770625 78.436375 or if the prescription say ran out or if you're using something that's uh older than older than the date uh on the package or whatever
sw2096A-ms98-a-0014 78.436375 85.855125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0015 85.855125 87.261750 yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0016 87.261750 88.899500 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0017 88.899500 93.608625 yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected
sw2096A-ms98-a-0018 93.608625 97.038875 uh we're required to go attend a uh a counseling session
sw2096A-ms98-a-0019 97.038875 100.642750 and uh that gets put in your permanent uh files on your record
sw2096A-ms98-a-0020 100.642750 106.987000 it's just not not a real good uh thing to have on your uh employment uh records
sw2096A-ms98-a-0021 106.987000 121.410750 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0022 121.410750 123.116500 sure
sw2096A-ms98-a-0023 123.116500 134.530250 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0024 134.530250 143.211375 yeah uh according to uh to the way that that our test is set up apparently everyone is supposed to be tested within a five year period
sw2096A-ms98-a-0025 143.211375 150.274875 and uh they they do it on a random basis i'm not sure how they can guarantee that everybody is going to be tested within five years if it really is random
sw2096A-ms98-a-0026 150.274875 152.983250 so i'm not sure exactly what they base that on
sw2096A-ms98-a-0027 152.983250 154.067125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0028 154.067125 156.025250 yeah um-hum sure
sw2096A-ms98-a-0029 156.025250 166.435375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0030 166.435375 168.304125 okay
sw2096A-ms98-a-0031 168.304125 170.798750 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0032 170.798750 176.633375 well i'm not sure exactly if that's true though because i know people that have been tested more than one time
sw2096A-ms98-a-0033 176.633375 178.910375 and many have not been tested yet
sw2096A-ms98-a-0034 178.910375 180.918625 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0035 180.918625 183.029375 uh couple of years yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0036 183.029375 185.543875 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0037 185.543875 189.331000 [laughter-okay] [laughter] it took them awhile to find me
sw2096A-ms98-a-0038 189.331000 193.152375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0039 193.152375 197.242750 oh no well th[ey]- they did all the all the top level managers
sw2096A-ms98-a-0040 197.242750 198.608000 uh at first
sw2096A-ms98-a-0041 198.608000 202.362750 and uh everybody else uh gets to take their turn
sw2096A-ms98-a-0042 202.362750 205.495625 so they called me in uh just a few months ago
sw2096A-ms98-a-0043 205.495625 208.429625 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0044 208.429625 209.621125 right
sw2096A-ms98-a-0045 209.621125 211.828250 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0046 211.828250 219.948250 oh no [laughter] i never thought about that i- i had some questions for the for the the nurse who was uh conducting the test in the health center though
sw2096A-ms98-a-0047 219.948250 222.422000 asked her if she enjoyed her job [laughter]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0048 222.422000 223.763750 [laughter]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0049 223.763750 226.842000 she thought it was different you get to meet a lot of people [laughter]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0050 226.842000 227.979750 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0051 227.979750 231.660250 so i try i try to introduce some levity there
sw2096A-ms98-a-0052 231.660250 236.352000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0053 236.352000 237.527875 uh-huh
sw2096A-ms98-a-0054 237.527875 242.474000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0055 242.474000 243.509375 yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0056 243.509375 244.502375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0057 244.502375 246.665500 [laughter]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0058 246.665500 248.697875 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0059 248.697875 250.353250 yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0060 250.353250 255.520875 yeah well there are a lot of people who express uh much stronger feelings about it than i have
sw2096A-ms98-a-0061 255.520875 266.893750 and in fact i know some people that uh probably will quit before being tested even though there's nothing to uh to worry about as far as i know from the test results just a matter of principle
sw2096A-ms98-a-0062 266.893750 275.998000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0063 275.998000 277.570000 oh yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0064 277.570000 302.444500 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0065 302.444500 313.943500 yeah well i know some people that i suspect are casual users of uh marijuana as well and i expect that they probably uh mended their ways uh in uh
sw2096A-ms98-a-0066 313.943500 320.555750 in response to this uh drug testing that they no longer uh even use anything like that on a casual basis
sw2096A-ms98-a-0067 320.555750 325.219125 because it is a matter of of losing your job if you get caught say a second time
sw2096A-ms98-a-0068 325.219125 334.501500 and even the first time uh for these people are uh oh well on their way in on on the technical ladder or management and they're jeopardizing their positions
sw2096A-ms98-a-0069 334.501500 341.566000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0070 341.566000 343.626875 yeah yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0071 343.626875 352.064875 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0072 352.064875 356.096500 well some companies have gone that far uh TI has not
sw2096A-ms98-a-0073 356.096500 361.159750 but others have and they're setting themselves up for uh more lawsuits i think than uh
sw2096A-ms98-a-0074 361.159750 362.049875 than we are
sw2096A-ms98-a-0075 362.049875 372.475125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0076 372.475125 373.823625 yeah
sw2096A-ms98-a-0077 373.823625 376.086000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0078 376.086000 385.992625 right i don't mind so much the fact that they test people but uh not questioning the validity of the results is is a problem because uh
sw2096A-ms98-a-0079 385.992625 387.894625 uh [laughter]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0080 387.894625 401.881125 i- i- i fully expect that that any test results that comeback for me would be negative that in in the event that one would be positive there's no recourse other than get yourself a lawyer or go to this counseling session and admit guilt uh they won't accept anything else
sw2096A-ms98-a-0081 401.881125 404.397875 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0082 404.397875 405.615625 right
sw2096A-ms98-a-0083 405.615625 410.460375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0084 410.460375 414.105000 yeah well if if you turn down the counseling the[y]- they will fire you
sw2096A-ms98-a-0085 414.105000 416.291000 that's uh condition of employment
sw2096A-ms98-a-0086 416.291000 422.462375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0087 422.462375 424.181500 sure
sw2096A-ms98-a-0088 424.181500 432.980000 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0089 432.980000 434.244375 is that right
sw2096A-ms98-a-0090 434.244375 437.267750 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0091 437.267750 440.991250 i thought that's the only one that the government does use so
sw2096A-ms98-a-0092 440.991250 442.035625 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0093 442.035625 443.433125 i'm not sure
sw2096A-ms98-a-0094 443.433125 446.792125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0095 446.792125 454.484250 okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well
sw2096A-ms98-a-0096 454.484250 465.561250 gives them full reign uh trust the results because_1 they have to prove on a continual basis that uh that they are meeting um their standards for false positives and whatnot
sw2096A-ms98-a-0097 465.561250 471.367500 they claim uh zero false positives ever and i find that very hard to believe
sw2096A-ms98-a-0098 471.367500 475.495375 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0099 475.495375 480.829500 okay well uh hum
sw2096A-ms98-a-0100 480.829500 485.824000 i think yeah i'm sure it is i think that about covers what we want to talk about
sw2096A-ms98-a-0101 485.824000 486.905125 [silence]
sw2096A-ms98-a-0102 486.905125 489.814750 i enjoyed it okay sure bye
sw2096A-ms98-a-0103 489.814750 491.953875 [noise]
