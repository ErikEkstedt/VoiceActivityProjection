sw2096B-ms98-a-0062 265.846375 277.784000 well um i guess growing up in the sixties and uh i don't know that particular era and generation i think about it though whether i have some friends who are occasional uh marijuana smokers and
sw2096B-ms98-a-0063 277.784000 281.839875 you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation
sw2096B-ms98-a-0064 281.839875 293.117375 and uh but yeah they're they're just adamant that they're not going to be you know tested and they're going to fight it and um you know try and um see what they can do that it's an invasion of privacy
sw2096B-ms98-a-0065 293.117375 303.436000 but i don't particularly care to uh you know to uh to get into drugs or anything else so it's not a problem for me but i uh i can kind of understand from the other point of view

sw2096B-ms98-a-0079 343.224250 352.565000 but the one thing too that that i have a problem with is that well if marijuana and cocaine and the other those so-called uh illegal drugs you know what about alcohol

sw2096B-ms98-a-0084 360.084250 368.134125 i think so yeah yeah but you know [vocalized-noise] alcohol destroys you know so many families so now
sw2096B-ms98-a-0085 368.134125 376.510000 so that's that's what i thought was interesting that uh there are still drugs out there and then there are those socially acceptable drugs

sw2096B-ms98-a-0096 426.638250 433.055750 and i understand that the government will not use that particular drug testing agency that that TI is using
sw2096B-ms98-a-0097 433.055750 437.603000 um [noise] yeah because they're not as reliable as the government wants them to be
