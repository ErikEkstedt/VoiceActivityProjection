sw2094A-ms98-a-0002 0.599500 10.760625 uh Robert what do you uh think what substances do you think are the most uh likely causes of air pollution

sw2094A-ms98-a-0004 22.033250 23.577750 right

sw2094A-ms98-a-0007 26.487000 38.629000 do you um do you think that those are bigger contributors than things like ai[r]- acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from industrial um areas factories and so on
sw2094A-ms98-a-0008 38.629000 45.013000 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0009 45.013000 48.713875 i was going to say and and you so you understand smog [laughter]

sw2094A-ms98-a-0011 51.498750 52.818625 um-hum
sw2094A-ms98-a-0012 52.818625 65.312625 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0013 65.312625 66.946375 wow
sw2094A-ms98-a-0014 66.946375 70.428750 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0015 70.428750 72.342250 my word
sw2094A-ms98-a-0016 72.342250 73.346750 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0017 73.346750 75.900000 and that was a few years ago
sw2094A-ms98-a-0018 75.900000 79.114375 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0019 79.114375 82.248750 i- i wonder if it's any better now
sw2094A-ms98-a-0020 82.248750 83.657750 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0021 83.657750 90.386375 because they uh California has such strict rules um about emissions and so on um
sw2094A-ms98-a-0022 90.386375 101.140875 i- i don't know if you h[eard]- uh heard about the uh recent legislation in um Colorado um against a power company
sw2094A-ms98-a-0023 101.140875 112.493750 uh that's actually on Indian land i believe but um it has uh been ruled against uh regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the Grand Canyon
sw2094A-ms98-a-0024 112.493750 126.431750 and um i[n]- particularly in the winter months so they it was uh a landmark case because it's unusual to um i can't think they they were talking about shutting it down or if it didn't comply and so on
sw2094A-ms98-a-0025 126.431750 133.288500 i don't know that the information is one of those wire services kind of new[s]- pieces of news you know and so it's hard
sw2094A-ms98-a-0026 133.288500 147.426625 i never did see the full [laughter-story] so i don't know but they said that it that it really caused so much smog over uh the Grand Canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the uh piloting uh you know the helicopter trips and that sort of thing
sw2094A-ms98-a-0027 147.426625 152.908250 which would be horrible because the there's nothing i mean that's such a spectacle it'd be a shame to ruin it
sw2094A-ms98-a-0028 152.908250 159.642000 uh what do you think individuals could do or society could do to alleviate this problem
sw2094A-ms98-a-0029 159.642000 170.949500 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0030 170.949500 172.433625 [laughter-right]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0031 172.433625 182.801750 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0032 182.801750 188.486750 um-hum you think it's more we[ll]- more in society well i guess i kind of agree there i
sw2094A-ms98-a-0033 188.486750 197.000625 um on an individual basis there isn't a lot that we can do about a lot of things but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can uh
sw2094A-ms98-a-0034 197.000625 208.473250 force uh government uh that we elect to deal more seriously with it and i do think that we have a responsibility there i must admit i'm not always real politically active but i do think that
sw2094A-ms98-a-0035 208.473250 220.246750 um Congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards and it's brought their the they uh really listen to the the uh lobbyist
sw2094A-ms98-a-0036 220.246750 233.610875 and uh the m[anufacturing]- car manufacturing companies have uh you know have really pushed saying all those re[strictions]- those restrictions too hard we can't we can't quite make that go and they don't and then we still live with air pollution
sw2094A-ms98-a-0037 233.610875 240.748250 um so i suspect that that's one thing that that as individuals we can do make our voices known perhaps to our legislators
sw2094A-ms98-a-0038 240.748250 247.040375 but um as a society i think we can do more and that's probably how we ought to do it
sw2094A-ms98-a-0039 247.040375 253.755500 uh individ[ually]- being individually responsible a[s]- as uh [laughter] in order to be group responsible
sw2094A-ms98-a-0040 253.755500 263.780500 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0041 263.780500 265.303250 right
sw2094A-ms98-a-0042 265.303250 276.039125 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0043 276.039125 277.420500 um-hum
sw2094A-ms98-a-0044 277.420500 282.223250 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0045 282.223250 292.929125 i suspect that the pub[lic]- that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure uh come to bear on the companies that deal with it and probably the only way that can happen is for um
sw2094A-ms98-a-0046 292.929125 297.131375 governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't
sw2094A-ms98-a-0047 297.131375 300.099375 and uh i don't know how long that that'll take
sw2094A-ms98-a-0048 300.099375 303.003000 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0049 303.003000 304.390375 sure
sw2094A-ms98-a-0050 304.390375 306.596875 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0051 306.596875 310.120000 exactly yeah right
sw2094A-ms98-a-0052 310.120000 314.192375 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0053 314.192375 315.500750 right
sw2094A-ms98-a-0054 315.500750 316.706125 [laughter-yeah]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0055 316.706125 318.543625 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0056 318.543625 331.166125 well it's just the same thing with the car um uh the gasoline now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline so that we don't um run into this kind of problems we've recently had
sw2094A-ms98-a-0057 331.166125 342.586750 and yet the government's not going to do that because people are too dependent and they don't wanna they don't want to pay for it so instead we spend billions of dollars going to war um you know f[or]- wha[t]- however
sw2094A-ms98-a-0058 342.586750 347.141375 i[t]- it might have had other causes certainly oil was a big factor
sw2094A-ms98-a-0059 347.141375 357.111750 um and i think that's probably going to happen with with such things as air pollution when we when we se[rious]- get serious about cleaning up our motors in our automobiles then uh
sw2094A-ms98-a-0060 357.111750 363.908500 then maybe you know we'll have a little bit of help um uh do you have any air pollution in your area
sw2094A-ms98-a-0061 363.908500 373.121000 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0062 373.121000 376.714750 oh no [laughter]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0063 376.714750 383.378125 your talking about from from the uh the middle middle states that that have more factories and so on
sw2094A-ms98-a-0064 383.378125 391.438250 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0065 391.438250 406.082750 yeah we really don't have that either although i think i can tell a difference in i lived in this area for about twenty five years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level um particularly in the summer
sw2094A-ms98-a-0066 406.082750 415.734875 uh you know when it gets hot and you have the that kind of a pressure from the pockets of air um usually they say caused by exhaust
sw2094A-ms98-a-0067 415.734875 424.212500 it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable and you know my eyes sting more and so on and so on so i suspect that it's it's an ever growing problem
sw2094A-ms98-a-0068 424.212500 429.687500 well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here it was nice talking to you
sw2094A-ms98-a-0069 429.687500 433.208000 [silence]
sw2094A-ms98-a-0070 433.208000 435.841750 so did i bye-bye
sw2094A-ms98-a-0071 435.841750 438.678000 [silence]
