sw2017B-ms98-a-0006 9.293750 18.629500 okay um well i've lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years
sw2017B-ms98-a-0007 18.629500 28.548625 and we're in our second home now we've been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson
sw2017B-ms98-a-0008 28.548625 29.753750 [noise]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0009 29.753750 35.170250 we've lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh
sw2017B-ms98-a-0010 35.170250 39.434125 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0011 39.434125 40.005875 [noise]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0012 40.005875 52.299250 well it's it's not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the uh the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same {pricewise} i would think
sw2017B-ms98-a-0013 52.299250 53.919625 yeah so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0014 53.919625 68.807875 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0015 68.807875 70.021125 yeah
sw2017B-ms98-a-0016 70.021125 74.077125 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0017 74.077125 76.884125 yeah well um
sw2017B-ms98-a-0018 76.884125 88.632750 [noise] i know i i think that there's some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i've it's been thirteen years since we've really priced a house so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0019 88.632750 100.219000 [laughter] so i'm not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our pri[ce]- that the the value of our house went up you know considerably o[ver]- over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period
sw2017B-ms98-a-0020 100.219000 108.034250 but then for the last several years it's pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0021 108.034250 117.692000 but uh we've done uh you know in order to maintain ours we've done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0022 117.692000 129.999000 uh but uh i guess i'm i'm a little encouraged with home prices i i'm a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days
sw2017B-ms98-a-0023 129.999000 140.363625 and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it's uh in Dallas but it's in the Richardson School District
sw2017B-ms98-a-0024 140.363625 152.965750 and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it's got everything she w[ant's]- you know thinks she'll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0025 152.965750 159.694875 so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now
sw2017B-ms98-a-0026 159.694875 165.998750 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0027 165.998750 177.889625 well i'm not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we've had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice
sw2017B-ms98-a-0028 177.889625 182.539875 because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that
sw2017B-ms98-a-0029 182.539875 194.476250 but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it's our fault but we had them_1 put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape 
sw2017B-ms98-a-0030 194.476250 199.983125 and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is
sw2017B-ms98-a-0031 199.983125 211.137250 and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house
sw2017B-ms98-a-0032 211.137250 219.475875 and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0033 219.475875 221.401375 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0034 221.401375 231.400625 no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it's soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right
sw2017B-ms98-a-0035 231.400625 235.243500 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0036 235.243500 238.525500 yeah uh but uh
sw2017B-ms98-a-0037 238.525500 251.346750 yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise
sw2017B-ms98-a-0038 251.346750 252.511500 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0039 252.511500 254.034000 yeah so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0040 254.034000 262.633750 [silence]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0041 262.633750 264.114250 um-hum

sw2017B-ms98-a-0043 268.733000 269.939875 [laughter]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0044 269.939875 283.818375 yeah but uh well our house and i'm not sure how all of the b[uilders]- you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation
sw2017B-ms98-a-0045 283.818375 293.266000 and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete
sw2017B-ms98-a-0046 293.266000 298.898000 and makes it more uh s[table]- more stable and and puts more strength into it
sw2017B-ms98-a-0047 298.898000 301.334000 so uh you know it it
sw2017B-ms98-a-0048 301.334000 302.129875 [noise]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0049 302.129875 309.973750 uh potentially that's supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0050 309.973750 311.460625 yeah so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0051 311.460625 313.523750 [noise]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0052 313.523750 316.704625 [silence]

sw2017B-ms98-a-0055 320.175750 321.579375 yeah
sw2017B-ms98-a-0056 321.579375 326.771875 right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam
sw2017B-ms98-a-0057 326.771875 327.533000 [noise]
sw2017B-ms98-a-0058 327.533000 337.958750 yeah so that's and that's what ours is our h[ouse]- the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house
sw2017B-ms98-a-0059 337.958750 345.643375 and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so
sw2017B-ms98-a-0060 345.643375 351.949000 yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you've got a if you have a good builder
sw2017B-ms98-a-0061 351.949000 353.898750 [noise]
