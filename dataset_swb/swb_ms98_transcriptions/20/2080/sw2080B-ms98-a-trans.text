sw2080B-ms98-a-0011 62.286875 65.953375 yeah the reason i asked is because
sw2080B-ms98-a-0012 65.953375 69.283125 we're embarking on a little adventure here
sw2080B-ms98-a-0013 69.283125 75.782000 in that we're going to use uh some timber framing techniques to build a
sw2080B-ms98-a-0014 75.782000 79.026250 a truss for a home
sw2080B-ms98-a-0015 79.026250 83.072875 and it's a it's a you know what a mansard roof is
sw2080B-ms98-a-0016 83.072875 84.728125 like a barn yeah
sw2080B-ms98-a-0017 84.728125 89.826000 and they're mansard trusses that don't have any internal bracing
sw2080B-ms98-a-0018 89.826000 93.463375 so the whole area is like a cathedral up there
sw2080B-ms98-a-0019 93.463375 95.631375 for the second floor
sw2080B-ms98-a-0020 95.631375 103.915125 [silence]

sw2080B-ms98-a-0026 119.559125 127.559875 yeah that that's done some where they're actually create a a single piece that is the trust
sw2080B-ms98-a-0027 127.559875 132.552500 but uh what i want to do is i want to make four identical components
sw2080B-ms98-a-0028 132.552500 137.529375 and uh cut the joints so that the
sw2080B-ms98-a-0029 137.529375 141.282750 the more pressure you put on it the stronger it gets
sw2080B-ms98-a-0030 141.282750 148.915875 and it involves interleaving and uh using uh you know locking wedges
sw2080B-ms98-a-0031 148.915875 154.229625 [silence]
sw2080B-ms98-a-0032 154.229625 156.701625 yeah similar to that yeah

sw2080B-ms98-a-0034 159.963625 165.153875 well if i do that and then cover it with uh two by six tongue and groove
sw2080B-ms98-a-0035 165.153875 170.740625 it will be pretty sturdy because we have to we we got what we call Santa Ana wind down here
sw2080B-ms98-a-0036 170.740625 174.912375 it comes up out of Mexico at about a hundred miles an hour
