sw2080A-ms98-a-0004 4.414750 14.272750 well yeah i like to do a little remodeling work and in older homes and stuff i just bought a home two years ago that's about sixty five years old and we've done a little work on it
sw2080A-ms98-a-0005 14.272750 17.250625 and uh about_1
sw2080A-ms98-a-0006 17.250625 19.340750 pardon me
sw2080A-ms98-a-0007 19.340750 22.409625 timber framing okay well
sw2080A-ms98-a-0008 22.409625 32.824125 other than you talking about like post and beam construction that type well not very much other than what i read we don't use much of that up here although i understand they do in the Southwest quite a bit
sw2080A-ms98-a-0009 32.824125 34.286500 but um
sw2080A-ms98-a-0010 34.286500 44.810875 up here we generally use uh uh frame construction work or wood frame construction with wooden siding and and you know most of your homes down south i guess are brick
sw2080A-ms98-a-0011 44.810875 54.071250 but here they're pretty much wood frame construction on a two by four's and and uh one by twelve boarding on the outside or sheet plywood
sw2080A-ms98-a-0012 54.071250 59.656625 and then some kind of a insulation material and covered with clapboards or shingles
sw2080A-ms98-a-0013 59.656625 62.761750 that's a typical New [laughter-England] home i guess
sw2080A-ms98-a-0014 62.761750 78.209875 [silence]
sw2080A-ms98-a-0015 78.209875 79.536250 ah

sw2080A-ms98-a-0020 94.648125 101.302125 oh okay that's unique we do a lot of truss roofs up here but they are they're again they're
sw2080A-ms98-a-0021 101.302125 108.245875 they're truss construction but they're well braced you know cross braced inside held together by steel cleats and stuff
sw2080A-ms98-a-0022 108.245875 112.280250 uh mansard roofs are are in bond building i guess are
sw2080A-ms98-a-0023 112.280250 114.202000 they do a lot of that
sw2080A-ms98-a-0024 114.202000 121.450375 i understand by laminating the series of of beams of planks together and and with
sw2080A-ms98-a-0025 121.450375 126.736375 [silence]

sw2080A-ms98-a-0030 148.013250 160.035500 sure sure something like the way you'd do uh um bricks around a window around a large window type thing the center the center brick is the key brick which locks everything together that's a pretty neat idea
sw2080A-ms98-a-0031 160.035500 162.558875 you building are you are y[ou]- [vocalized-noise]

sw2080A-ms98-a-0047 216.232500 228.904000 i saw a log cabin built down there that i was really impressed with and it sounds like it's similar to the open construction that you're going to have where the only thing enclosed upstairs were the bedrooms
sw2080A-ms98-a-0048 228.904000 239.925625 but the rest of the center portion of the cabin which was a huge huge house was all open and the thing i really liked about it was it had a porch on all four sides of the house
sw2080A-ms98-a-0049 239.925625 242.171000 all the way around the house

sw2080A-ms98-a-0066 305.366250 309.500250 yeah out in West Texas there was hardly any at all in Abilene but
