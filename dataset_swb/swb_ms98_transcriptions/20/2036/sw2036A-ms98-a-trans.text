sw2036A-ms98-a-0005 21.627250 26.371750 the United States the the language was a little bit different although he did speak English
sw2036A-ms98-a-0006 26.371750 29.189875 it was just some of the [vocalized-noise] excuse me

sw2036A-ms98-a-0014 50.615000 52.430750 okay
sw2036A-ms98-a-0015 52.430750 58.255250 uh my dad flew down there for about a year he was down there about once a month one week per month 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0016 58.255250 59.887875 and uh 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0017 59.887875 67.619750 i wanted to move there it sounded like uh a neat place to live an island in the sun you know and uh 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0018 67.619750 76.736375 it turned out my mom was the only one in the family that didn't want to go because she didn't play golf or tennis [laughter] and there wasn't really a job for her there 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0019 76.736375 81.717750 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0020 81.717750 83.074125 yeah

sw2036A-ms98-a-0027 95.817250 99.467000 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0028 99.467000 104.724375 yeah i lived in Colorado for a while and people kept saying the same thing to me oh it must have been great 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0029 104.724375 107.293875 i go oh it was just a place to [laughter-live] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0030 107.293875 109.691125 yeah i was
sw2036A-ms98-a-0031 109.691125 115.376750 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0032 115.376750 126.705625 i- i think the status quo seems to be working i don't think um from talking to Jerry my friend that lived there that they don't seem um upset about it or anything and 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0033 126.705625 130.007875 i think it would upset more people if they tried to change it
sw2036A-ms98-a-0034 130.007875 137.060125 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0035 137.060125 138.710500 yeah 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0036 138.710500 143.207500 i don't know fifty one stars on this flag wouldn't look too [laughter-good] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0037 143.207500 144.462625 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0038 144.462625 150.567625 yeah if they got another state they could bring two in and fifty two might be able to uh be arranged better i don't know 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0039 150.567625 151.624125 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0040 151.624125 155.213250 yeah i don't know cut California in half or something 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0041 155.213250 156.658125 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0042 156.658125 163.913250 but um i know a lot of the major companies kind of like it because they'll build plants down there because_1 they don't have to pay taxes on the stuff 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0043 163.913250 171.973250 um and they make i guess it's no income tax there or fed[eral]- no federal income tax something like that 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0044 171.973250 173.482750 yeah 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0045 173.482750 175.216500 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0046 175.216500 178.040750 um yeah i think it's a territory 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0047 178.040750 179.886500 that makes sense 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0048 179.886500 187.024625 i mean there's uh lots of tiny islands in the South Pacific that are territories like that they could make states like Guam 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0049 187.024625 187.401000 [noise]
sw2036A-ms98-a-0050 187.401000 188.572250 or uh
sw2036A-ms98-a-0051 188.572250 189.677250 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0052 189.677250 194.625500 yeah it's a U S territory and it's just we own it or 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0053 194.625500 196.179000 yeah 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0054 196.179000 197.715625 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0055 197.715625 201.411250 well Hawaii is pretty far too think about it 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0056 201.411250 203.082375 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0057 203.082375 204.344250 yeah

sw2036A-ms98-a-0059 210.417000 211.904375 yeah 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0060 211.904375 215.309000 it's definitely a way out of the way where [vocalized-noise] where as 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0061 215.309000 216.833625 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0062 216.833625 218.299125 uh-huh 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0063 218.299125 222.364750 yeah where as Puerto Rico is pretty close by 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0064 222.364750 224.193750 which 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0065 224.193750 225.473000 i don't know
sw2036A-ms98-a-0066 225.473000 227.327875 [silence]
sw2036A-ms98-a-0067 227.327875 228.995625 [laughter] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0068 228.995625 231.530500 no i don't think they would 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0069 231.530500 233.014500 yeah 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0070 233.014500 236.619750 but actually i knew another guy from Puerto Rico that i went to school with
sw2036A-ms98-a-0071 236.619750 241.025250 and he was coming he came to America to to go to school
sw2036A-ms98-a-0072 241.025250 244.794125 and i think he was going to go back be an engineer out there 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0073 244.794125 246.780500 he was really funny [laughter] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0074 246.780500 251.181750 both of the ones i met have been really funny guys i don't know if that's uh 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0075 251.181750 252.274375 [silence]
sw2036A-ms98-a-0076 252.274375 255.986750 if that's true about all Puerto Ricans or not 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0077 255.986750 258.921250 ones i met have been pretty pretty funny
sw2036A-ms98-a-0078 258.921250 265.774250 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0079 265.774250 276.505750 yeah i don't i didn't hear any major complaints about it um [noise] i definitely think that we ought to let them decide and not say okay you're a state now or you're your own country or whatever 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0080 276.505750 278.653500 but um let them decide 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0081 278.653500 283.383000 [silence] 
sw2036A-ms98-a-0082 283.383000 284.663500 yeah
sw2036A-ms98-a-0083 284.663500 286.121625 [silence]

sw2036A-ms98-a-0085 287.301250 289.945500 i think that makes the most sense
sw2036A-ms98-a-0086 289.945500 291.735375 hum
sw2036A-ms98-a-0087 291.735375 295.665125 okay ha[ve]- we have we been on for a long enough time
