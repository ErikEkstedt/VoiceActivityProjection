sw2089A-ms98-a-0035 136.421875 140.892625 yeah well i don't either really i- i like messing with the lures and [vocalized-noise]
sw2089A-ms98-a-0036 140.892625 152.473250 that seems to be what the the bass like and what you can catch with the lures so that's that's generally what i fish for you know because_1 i don't particularly like to eat fish i just like to catch them_1 and throw them_1 back
sw2089A-ms98-a-0037 152.473250 165.299750 but it's uh you know i- i got into that mode where i was buying lures and and rods and reels and [vocalized-noise] just all kinds of stuff i had one of those little two man uh little two man boats that
sw2089A-ms98-a-0038 165.299750 168.448125 used to go around a lot use that a lot but
sw2089A-ms98-a-0039 168.448125 175.327875 like i say i kind of got out of the fishing business when the kids got up big enough so i got sold that and
sw2089A-ms98-a-0040 175.327875 177.552625 but it's uh
sw2089A-ms98-a-0041 177.552625 182.323125 but yeah so i'm kind of limited now to [vocalized-noise] going back to my old farm pond
sw2089A-ms98-a-0042 182.323125 186.231875 [silence]
sw2089A-ms98-a-0043 186.231875 191.168625 well as a matter of fact uh last last fall uh in uh
sw2089A-ms98-a-0044 191.168625 196.046750 October i guess i bought uh i bought a boat but i bought a a ski boat
sw2089A-ms98-a-0045 196.046750 198.860375 gonna keep it
sw2089A-ms98-a-0046 198.860375 205.458875 yeah yeah you can it's it's not the same as a bass boat but yeah you can get out on the water that's the main thing
sw2089A-ms98-a-0047 205.458875 213.648375 but i- i used to go with a friend at work quite a bit uh he had uh he had a uh bass boat and he's the one i went to uh
sw2089A-ms98-a-0048 213.648375 219.538000 oh like i say we went to Lake Fork and Cypress Springs and we've been to Lavon and Texoma just
sw2089A-ms98-a-0049 219.538000 223.038500 [vocalized-noise] been around quite a bit in the kind of local area
sw2089A-ms98-a-0050 223.038500 226.499875 but he sold his boat too so [laughter] so we just kind of
sw2089A-ms98-a-0051 226.499875 229.224625 we kind of grounded ourselves in that respect
sw2089A-ms98-a-0052 229.224625 235.455375 [silence]

sw2089A-ms98-a-0055 240.697000 249.823125 yeah that's well you don't have to but it it makes it easier you got to have uh well if you have a Texoma license you can fish anywhere on the lake
sw2089A-ms98-a-0056 249.823125 259.084750 if you have only a Texas license you have to stay on the Texas side of the lake which uh uh as it turns out most of the lake is in Oklahoma

sw2089A-ms98-a-0111 442.321000 449.814375 pushing a MasterCard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on on conservation measures and stuff
sw2089A-ms98-a-0112 449.814375 452.057500 which is a good idea i guess

sw2089A-ms98-a-0115 455.775625 464.357000 yeah especially as popular as fishing is getting you know in the last few years last five or ten years i guess it's it's really picked up in popularity again
sw2089A-ms98-a-0116 464.357000 465.610625 so it's a lot more
sw2089A-ms98-a-0117 465.610625 472.651125 you know a lot more people using the lakes and facilities and putting more pressure on the fish and taking more fish out of the lakes
