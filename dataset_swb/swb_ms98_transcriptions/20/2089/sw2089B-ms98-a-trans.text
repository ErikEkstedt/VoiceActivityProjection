sw2089B-ms98-a-0053 228.643750 235.888000 yeah well the last time i had anticipated fishing i thought i might fish at Lake Texoma i was going up there with a group
sw2089B-ms98-a-0054 235.888000 237.260625 and uh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0055 237.260625 241.856250 when i got there discovered you have to have a s[pecial]- special license to fish on the lake right
sw2089B-ms98-a-0056 241.856250 249.319500 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0057 249.319500 250.564750 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0058 250.564750 258.593250 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0059 258.593250 265.330875 yeah well that's what i understood anyway i- i d[iscovered]- discovered it was m[uch]- much better to have uh uh Texoma license
sw2089B-ms98-a-0060 265.330875 271.698125 and i didn't have that so i said well i wasn't going to that plus there wasn't anybody else fishing you know in the group so i said well i just won't worry about it
sw2089B-ms98-a-0061 271.698125 276.035875 and that was probably the last time i even tried to fish and or even thought about it but
sw2089B-ms98-a-0062 276.035875 280.383875 i've got uh my fishing tackle in the trunk of my car so if the urge ever
sw2089B-ms98-a-0063 280.383875 282.956000 ever bites [laughter-you] [laughter-know] [laughter-i'm] kind of available but
sw2089B-ms98-a-0064 282.956000 286.011125 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0065 286.011125 287.486250 yeah right
sw2089B-ms98-a-0066 287.486250 288.904125 but
sw2089B-ms98-a-0067 288.904125 299.371625 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0068 299.371625 300.663875 yeah

sw2089B-ms98-a-0072 311.656500 312.859500 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0073 312.859500 316.025875 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0074 316.025875 317.261375 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0075 317.261375 323.906625 but uh do you uh read anything about fishing do you have any any books or magazines or anything that you take that you
sw2089B-ms98-a-0076 323.906625 326.465250 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0077 326.465250 329.549875 yeah well i enjoy him too yeah but uh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0078 329.549875 329.672375 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0079 329.672375 338.011625 yeah i watch i- i take uh have just started taking the that bass joined the Bass Anglers Club you know and get their magazine
sw2089B-ms98-a-0080 338.011625 341.332375 and uh then i take the Texas Fisherman
sw2089B-ms98-a-0081 341.332375 342.506125 uh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0082 342.506125 353.751750 and uh you know i find those to be pretty good they uh the Texas Fisherman they uh they do cover a pretty broad range of fishing but they cover a lot spend a lot of time on salt water you know
sw2089B-ms98-a-0083 353.751750 355.432125 along the coast
sw2089B-ms98-a-0084 355.432125 359.094000 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0085 359.094000 360.255875 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0086 360.255875 364.780375 uh-huh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0087 364.780375 372.146750 yeah and then of course i guess the Bass you know the Bass Anglers book is uh covers the pretty well covers the country
sw2089B-ms98-a-0088 372.146750 376.913875 so you don't get a lot of Texas you know in particular coverage in that but
sw2089B-ms98-a-0089 376.913875 378.794000 still you get some pretty good tips
sw2089B-ms98-a-0090 378.794000 379.810500 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0091 379.810500 383.004375 i believe so it's their headquarters are in Alabama so
sw2089B-ms98-a-0092 383.004375 387.266000 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0093 387.266000 396.711125 well [vocalized-noise] uh there's a number of things that you can get but basically you get the the magazine and you get that patch you know you know you get a patch and you get the bumper sticker
sw2089B-ms98-a-0094 396.711125 405.984625 but then they they're always i just joined just signed up for the magazine here a month or so ago but they you know they send you offers and things uh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0095 405.984625 408.977750 l[ure]- lure packages and things like that that you can
sw2089B-ms98-a-0096 408.977750 414.807500 if you matter of fact if you uh get other people to sign up you know that to to sign up for the thing you know
sw2089B-ms98-a-0097 414.807500 419.842500 then you get lure packages or pocket knives or things like that but
sw2089B-ms98-a-0098 419.842500 426.426625 but they've got uh i think they might even have a a Visa card or something that they promote you know through the club and
sw2089B-ms98-a-0099 426.426625 432.164750 they've got uh discounts on travel rental cars and things like that that
sw2089B-ms98-a-0100 432.164750 436.139875 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0101 436.139875 437.443000 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0102 437.443000 439.154125 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0103 439.154125 440.400500 right
sw2089B-ms98-a-0104 440.400500 448.767125 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0105 448.767125 450.079500 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0106 450.079500 456.469625 yeah it's a good idea i think i think we need to we need to do a lot more on on the conservation than you know
sw2089B-ms98-a-0107 456.469625 463.357500 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0108 463.357500 464.566125 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0109 464.566125 472.156625 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0110 472.156625 479.141750 yeah so you haven't fished uh Joe Pool Lake down here yet i guess or uh what's the other one Ray Roberts is that
sw2089B-ms98-a-0111 479.141750 480.739000 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0112 480.739000 481.985375 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0113 481.985375 484.044250 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0114 484.044250 485.559625 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0115 485.559625 493.614375 yeah but uh yeah i uh Joe Pool is so close uh you know close into Dallas it's a little bit of a drive from Richardson
sw2089B-ms98-a-0116 493.614375 498.959125 to get down there but i've got a uh couple of clients that are down in that area
sw2089B-ms98-a-0117 498.959125 503.186625 i just i just i thought that it might be convenient for me sometime to just
sw2089B-ms98-a-0118 503.186625 505.733125 like i said just pull over and fish a while
sw2089B-ms98-a-0119 505.733125 508.853750 if i can find a p[lace]- a place to get to the water somehow
sw2089B-ms98-a-0120 508.853750 513.427625 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0121 513.427625 525.164250 yeah so i guess the the main thing is you know when you're [vocalized-noise] like you say when you're carrying your tackle around in the trunk of your car and you don't have a boat [laughter-laying] in the trunk your car y[ou're]- you're kind of restricted to bank fishing so 
sw2089B-ms98-a-0122 525.164250 526.936625 so you have to find a spot
sw2089B-ms98-a-0123 526.936625 527.949750 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0124 527.949750 529.086875 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0125 529.086875 530.559250 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0126 530.559250 535.210750 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0127 535.210750 543.401125 yeah yeah i enjoy watching the just watching the lure work in the water sometimes just see what it does it uh [laughter]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0128 543.401125 544.597875 yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0129 544.597875 546.260000 [noise] yeah
sw2089B-ms98-a-0130 546.260000 554.784375 [vocalized-noise] one thing uh in fishing that i have not ever [vocalized-noise] have not done and i'm not really sure what they mean i guess is when they're talking about
sw2089B-ms98-a-0131 554.784375 559.763750 using a jig and pig i think is the term does that mean that they
sw2089B-ms98-a-0132 559.763750 570.193750 like they use uh just uh it's like a hook with a little head on it and then just tie a piece of uh of rubber pork type stuff on the hook itself
sw2089B-ms98-a-0133 570.193750 576.070500 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0134 576.070500 577.402625 um-hum
sw2089B-ms98-a-0135 577.402625 579.267250 but it's just hung on the hook
sw2089B-ms98-a-0136 579.267250 580.306250 yeah huh
sw2089B-ms98-a-0137 580.306250 588.501625 i guess i couldn't imagine that it [vocalized-noise] anything like that until i started reading about it and you know and i thought you know that sounds like okay [laughter-but] i never would have thought of doing it so
sw2089B-ms98-a-0138 588.501625 598.640125 [silence]
sw2089B-ms98-a-0139 598.640125 600.210875 um-hum
