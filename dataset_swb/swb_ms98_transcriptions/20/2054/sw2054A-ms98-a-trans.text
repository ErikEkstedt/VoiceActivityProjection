sw2054A-ms98-a-0003 7.896250 14.405875 which took down all of our trees all the power lines all the phone lines
sw2054A-ms98-a-0004 14.405875 19.660250 it was i[t]- it was incredible it um it occurred about two thirty at night
sw2054A-ms98-a-0005 19.660250 26.566250 or in the morning actually um for the past six days we've been out heat without power
sw2054A-ms98-a-0006 26.566250 34.988375 um without a phone we've basically been living out of suitcases at friend's house that happened to have power it's really been horrible

sw2054A-ms98-a-0008 38.375125 49.861875 so i mean normally you know this time of year it's very cold and we have a lot of snow and and all that and this has just been something we've we've never seen an ice storm like this before
sw2054A-ms98-a-0009 49.861875 54.300625 and people that actually were staying home um
sw2054A-ms98-a-0010 54.300625 61.383125 without any heat they were estimating it was getting down to about thirty degrees inside the house without any heat
sw2054A-ms98-a-0011 61.383125 63.143500 it's really been crazy

sw2054A-ms98-a-0041 150.746000 154.984750 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0042 154.984750 164.023375 this past Thursday we had winds and and snow to the point where if you walked outside and if you're walking against the wind
sw2054A-ms98-a-0043 164.023375 171.759500 you almost couldn't move because the wind w[ouldn't]- wouldn't let you walk it was so strong it was really
sw2054A-ms98-a-0044 171.759500 176.152500 well um on Monday all the businesses were closed
sw2054A-ms98-a-0045 176.152500 180.356625 and then on Tuesday i would say about half of the businesses were closed
sw2054A-ms98-a-0046 180.356625 189.577875 um they finally opened up again i- i don't want to even say as normal because nothing was really normal this week people were [noise] faced with
sw2054A-ms98-a-0047 189.577875 195.728875 trees through their cars you know trees had fallen right on top of their cars um
sw2054A-ms98-a-0048 195.728875 199.997500 other people had had trees go right through there rooftops
sw2054A-ms98-a-0049 199.997500 205.583125 it's just i[t]- th[at]- as a matter of fact um Governor Cuomo the Governor of New York
sw2054A-ms98-a-0050 205.583125 213.091250 is supposedly asking Bush now to declare Rochester um a disasters area
sw2054A-ms98-a-0051 213.091250 217.003375 and obviously to get some funding to help clean up this mess
sw2054A-ms98-a-0052 217.003375 222.189625 but it's really you know besides just the inconvenience of it all it's it's pretty sad because
sw2054A-ms98-a-0053 222.189625 229.690625 Rochester had some nice parks and some really beautiful tree lined streets and they're all just destroyed
sw2054A-ms98-a-0054 229.690625 235.216875 they were all torn down um the ice i[t]- it was really just a crippling
sw2054A-ms98-a-0055 235.216875 237.296500 thing for the whole city
sw2054A-ms98-a-0056 237.296500 240.260375 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0057 240.260375 242.486125 i can imagine there be

sw2054A-ms98-a-0071 281.259375 289.281625 well i grew up in Boston and in Boston um we get our share of snow but it was always very very well cleaned up
sw2054A-ms98-a-0072 289.281625 295.836250 they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know it would then the next morning it would be fine
sw2054A-ms98-a-0073 295.836250 303.925000 and in Rochester they i guess they feel that they get so much snow that they don't clean it up for just a little bit
sw2054A-ms98-a-0074 303.925000 309.936875 so even for three or four inches you're just driving right on it the streets haven't been plowed
sw2054A-ms98-a-0075 309.936875 314.486375 there's no salt on the ground nothing they wait -[un]til they get a major storm
sw2054A-ms98-a-0076 314.486375 318.480375 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0077 318.480375 320.528000 oh really

sw2054A-ms98-a-0092 348.272875 352.751125 i thought you were saying can you hold on oh okay
sw2054A-ms98-a-0093 352.751125 354.412375 uh oh i see [laughter]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0094 354.412375 355.991750 [noise]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0095 355.991750 365.880875 well i just came back from getting our new clothes for today and we'll try l[ast]- we stayed all last week with one set of friends and um
sw2054A-ms98-a-0096 365.880875 373.729875 they were having company this weekend so we had to move and you just feel like you're imposing on people you know
sw2054A-ms98-a-0097 373.729875 380.093000 oh no they're averaging um well there estimating that next by next Thursday
sw2054A-ms98-a-0098 380.093000 382.179750 everybody should have there power back
sw2054A-ms98-a-0099 382.179750 383.284500 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0100 383.284500 388.924875 the schools were all closed this week and they're still thinking of closing them on Monday because
sw2054A-ms98-a-0101 388.924875 397.246000 for little kids it's it's still kind of dangerous on to be on the sidewalks because there might be some live wires hanging down and
sw2054A-ms98-a-0102 397.246000 400.254250 and there're a lot of streets that are just closed
sw2054A-ms98-a-0103 400.254250 404.828625 because you just can't drive on them and there's too many trees and that sort of thing
sw2054A-ms98-a-0104 404.828625 413.559750 but i[t]- one thing that was very funny is on Monday um almost every single store in Rochester had been sold out of batteries
sw2054A-ms98-a-0105 413.559750 420.137000 because people are needing batteries for portable radios and flashlights and
sw2054A-ms98-a-0106 420.137000 421.621875 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0107 421.621875 428.187000 really and we had uh you know a -[re]fr[igerator]- a refrigerator full of food and a freezer full of food
sw2054A-ms98-a-0108 428.187000 433.895125 and that's all been just you know it's you can't use it it's it's just gone bad
sw2054A-ms98-a-0109 433.895125 438.287625 so this storm really i[t's]- uh it's been incredible
sw2054A-ms98-a-0110 438.287625 441.330625 [silence]
sw2054A-ms98-a-0111 441.330625 447.833375 right exactly as a matter of fact we made on to i don't know if you ever watch Dan Rather
sw2054A-ms98-a-0112 447.833375 449.784000 the CBS news
sw2054A-ms98-a-0113 449.784000 455.936375 he mentioned um i guess it was Monday night or Tuesday night he mentioned the state of emergency
sw2054A-ms98-a-0114 455.936375 460.577250 and we all felt like finally we made it to the national news [laughter] but
sw2054A-ms98-a-0115 460.577250 466.513625 i don't know i would much rather be in the warm of sun
sw2054A-ms98-a-0116 466.513625 469.892250 [silence]

sw2054A-ms98-a-0120 476.701250 479.312750 and they just finished putting in a pool
sw2054A-ms98-a-0121 479.312750 484.671500 so while i was sitting freezing in a pay phone outside of our house
sw2054A-ms98-a-0122 484.671500 489.939250 um they were sitting by the pool sipping you know a glass of wine and
sw2054A-ms98-a-0123 489.939250 492.604375 oh it was really it was horrible
sw2054A-ms98-a-0124 492.604375 493.814625 but

sw2054A-ms98-a-0130 509.941250 513.553750 you know you can hear about it on TV and you just think so
sw2054A-ms98-a-0131 513.553750 517.652000 yeah exactly and you just never think it could happen to you
sw2054A-ms98-a-0132 517.652000 518.923875 but
sw2054A-ms98-a-0133 518.923875 526.854125 [silence]

sw2054A-ms98-a-0138 535.477500 540.111625 well western New York is suppose to be use to this kind of weather but
sw2054A-ms98-a-0139 540.111625 543.878625 right now people uh the the crews that are
sw2054A-ms98-a-0140 543.878625 546.216875 no it's true
sw2054A-ms98-a-0141 546.216875 551.461250 but there are some people that just love it i mean there are people that even if it gets to
sw2054A-ms98-a-0142 551.461250 554.204750 sixty degrees they feel that's too hot
sw2054A-ms98-a-0143 554.204750 561.038125 and they just they enjoy the snow and they enjoy the cold and and that's why they live here i guess but

sw2054A-ms98-a-0145 566.678000 571.878625 if you don't like the snow and the cold then you might as well just pack your bags and leave
