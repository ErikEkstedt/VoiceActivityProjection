sw2067A-ms98-a-0003 12.738875 16.276375 [laughter] what are you afraid of with them
sw2067A-ms98-a-0004 16.276375 18.011125 yes

sw2067A-ms98-a-0009 36.712250 41.234250 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0010 41.234250 50.525625 well that's the idea they figure that if they give you a card at no charge for a whole year that you will use it and
sw2067A-ms98-a-0011 50.525625 51.742375 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0012 51.742375 60.963750 absolutely well the other thing of course is the fact that they hope you will not pay your bill at the end of the month so that you will be paying interest
sw2067A-ms98-a-0013 60.963750 72.429250 i use mine a great deal um for groceries for everything that i can and then just write one check at the end of the month for the entire thing right
sw2067A-ms98-a-0014 72.429250 77.715125 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0015 77.715125 84.983750 that's all right sounds like you have a little one there oh you have great how old are they
sw2067A-ms98-a-0016 84.983750 85.976125 [silence]

sw2067A-ms98-a-0018 90.937625 103.496375 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0019 103.496375 110.247625 uh-huh well uh do you uh do you ever use the ATM machines
sw2067A-ms98-a-0020 110.247625 121.205625 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0021 121.205625 123.332625 [laughter]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0022 123.332625 131.716250 well i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks in order to get cash
sw2067A-ms98-a-0023 131.716250 135.732625 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0024 135.732625 146.604250 oh that helps right well the the other thing some people are not aware of is they will use their a their credit card like their Visa or their MasterCard for cash
sw2067A-ms98-a-0025 146.604250 153.239125 and when they do that they begin paying interest right from that very day on
sw2067A-ms98-a-0026 153.239125 154.357250 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0027 154.357250 161.741125 yeah right absolutely because they figure that [noise] that's correct [laughter] the idea is to use their [laughter-money]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0028 161.741125 162.984625 [laughter]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0029 162.984625 167.489875 and uh during that whole month and then pay it at the end of the month
sw2067A-ms98-a-0030 167.489875 170.252500 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0031 170.252500 171.826750 um-hum
sw2067A-ms98-a-0032 171.826750 175.328250 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0033 175.328250 181.984125 right well i think that's the only thing you can do is just say no and mean no and not be tempted
sw2067A-ms98-a-0034 181.984125 187.829250 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0035 187.829250 189.808250 well i[t]-
sw2067A-ms98-a-0036 189.808250 194.486250 and oh absolutely preapproved that's their favorite word
sw2067A-ms98-a-0037 194.486250 206.994625 [laughter] i think so you're right well it's interesting uh that uh people have the generally the same view of credit cards no matter where you go
sw2067A-ms98-a-0038 206.994625 214.768250 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0039 214.768250 217.201125 that much spent right
sw2067A-ms98-a-0040 217.201125 219.365875 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0041 219.365875 229.466750 well and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own and i mean that does nothing but exacerbate the entire problem
sw2067A-ms98-a-0042 229.466750 238.729500 [silence]
sw2067A-ms98-a-0043 238.729500 244.982250 that's right that's right well it's been enjoyable talking with you
