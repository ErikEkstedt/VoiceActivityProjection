sw2061A-ms98-a-0024 56.001875 58.395750 at North Carolina State University
sw2061A-ms98-a-0025 58.395750 60.228375 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0026 60.228375 62.521250 uh i don't because uh

sw2061A-ms98-a-0028 68.066750 75.805750 yeah that area and it's really small all all you have is like towns built around universities like Chapel Hill

sw2061A-ms98-a-0030 79.275125 80.476000 yeah

sw2061A-ms98-a-0040 106.066125 112.009375 oh okay because um i was looking at at the doctorate degree in Computer Science center at Berkeley
sw2061A-ms98-a-0041 112.009375 125.426750 and they're asking like for a um [vocalized-noise] GPA of like three point seven or something like that and like they're looking like for uh GRE like ninety nine percentile and this and that and it's like 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0042 125.426750 127.170875 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0043 127.170875 130.397250 yeah i know that's why that's why i didn't apply i mean it was like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0044 130.397250 137.453000 for me it was like practically impossible to get between like ninety and ninety nine percentile on the on the verbal part
sw2061A-ms98-a-0045 137.453000 147.044625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0046 147.044625 147.830250 yeah

sw2061A-ms98-a-0055 168.101125 170.940000 but uh but what if they pay for it
sw2061A-ms98-a-0056 170.940000 173.016875 [noise] what if they pay for
sw2061A-ms98-a-0057 173.016875 174.360625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0058 174.360625 175.498500 yeah

sw2061A-ms98-a-0060 180.212000 186.497250 because i know i know a couple of people here that work for um the Army um
sw2061A-ms98-a-0061 186.497250 187.630250 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0062 187.630250 191.893500 i think i think they're military but i mean the guy is still in
sw2061A-ms98-a-0063 191.893500 196.017875 and um h[e]- uh he works over in Maryland
sw2061A-ms98-a-0064 196.017875 204.119125 and so he's doing his Master's here they gave him like a scholarship like for a year and he's doing it in like in a year and a summer
sw2061A-ms98-a-0065 204.119125 211.361125 and so he's getting that and uh they said like they got a lot of benefits and that that's why you want to join
sw2061A-ms98-a-0066 211.361125 220.647750 but uh this guy i mean you can earn a lot more money so you say i go why you still there if you can earn a lot more money once you've get your your you know Master's
sw2061A-ms98-a-0067 220.647750 225.120375 they go well they got a lot of benefits that would go with it so
sw2061A-ms98-a-0068 225.120375 228.170500 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0069 228.170500 229.492500 yeah
sw2061A-ms98-a-0070 229.492500 232.605125 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0071 232.605125 238.902375 but i mean i mean you the once you get your Master's you can be earning between anywhere between like thirty seven forty five thousand a year
sw2061A-ms98-a-0072 238.902375 239.946000 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0073 239.946000 240.798500 and
sw2061A-ms98-a-0074 240.798500 242.421250 and that's not what they're paying
sw2061A-ms98-a-0075 242.421250 244.990250 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0076 244.990250 246.885625 yeah yeah [laughter-i] [laughter-know]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0077 246.885625 252.031625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0078 252.031625 252.956000 yeah
sw2061A-ms98-a-0079 252.956000 253.769625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0080 253.769625 255.002500 but that's uh
sw2061A-ms98-a-0081 255.002500 256.222500 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0082 256.222500 256.988125 yeah
sw2061A-ms98-a-0083 256.988125 261.127750 it's uh it's like uh in IBM in IBM you can get certain points 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0084 261.127750 268.314375 and uh everyone's a manager but nobody can get one more point to become you know like whatever you need to earn so much money
sw2061A-ms98-a-0085 268.314375 274.105875 you know it's like no i- i mean IBM is like there's a joke about IBM which says you know it's like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0086 274.105875 278.803375 uh all all the major companies get into a a boating race right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0087 278.803375 282.741625 and so IBM says well we have t[o]- we have to have a team right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0088 282.741625 290.561750 and then they come in last and they have this whole team you know analyze why they came in last right because the person asked for it
sw2061A-ms98-a-0089 290.561750 297.655500 saying he goes uh the problem was that there were five people saying row row row and one person rowing right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0090 297.655500 308.868750 so he goes have you come up with a -[so]lution uh have you come up with a solution they go yeah change the rower [laughter] you know it's like everyone's a manager but you know it's like only use like one person does the work so
sw2061A-ms98-a-0091 308.868750 310.849375 yeah so
sw2061A-ms98-a-0092 310.849375 312.430625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0093 312.430625 318.661000 yeah that well that's the way it works i mean that's that's why they're having problems i mean everyone's a manager and
sw2061A-ms98-a-0094 318.661000 324.056250 yeah i mean it's like it's like the people that actually do the work there
sw2061A-ms98-a-0095 324.056250 335.375250 are uh very few and then the other people just plan it you know it's like it's like have you have have you ever seen the commercial like for Federal Express where the with uh the think tank
sw2061A-ms98-a-0096 335.375250 347.108375 you know like all these people are just standing s[itting]- s[itting]- sitting around just going you know like what shall we do has anybody thought of anything no And then this guy from Federal Federal Express comes along they go what's that this track
sw2061A-ms98-a-0097 347.108375 351.368875 which it's going around the world and they can tell you where your package is anywhere any time
sw2061A-ms98-a-0098 351.368875 362.101125 and so it's like the same thing with IBM you know so they have this think tank and they got to come up with ideas but see uh the the thing is that IBM is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff
sw2061A-ms98-a-0099 362.101125 365.218750 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0100 365.218750 366.542125 yeah
sw2061A-ms98-a-0101 366.542125 376.454000 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0102 376.454000 379.168250 and it fails and you're dead
sw2061A-ms98-a-0103 379.168250 383.085125 yeah well IBM doesn't fire anybody
sw2061A-ms98-a-0104 383.085125 387.244625 because uh what they do is they they put you in a different job
sw2061A-ms98-a-0105 387.244625 392.428500 which y[ou]- you actually are like sitting around not doing anything so you quit
sw2061A-ms98-a-0106 392.428500 398.374750 i mean that's their policy they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally
sw2061A-ms98-a-0107 398.374750 401.852875 yeah like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that
sw2061A-ms98-a-0108 401.852875 405.068000 but they won't let you off what they'll do is like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0109 405.068000 409.858250 suppose you know like you're a manager so they'll put you into
sw2061A-ms98-a-0110 409.858250 414.045500 keeping up the paper you know it's like how much paper is going in
sw2061A-ms98-a-0111 414.045500 416.759750 and then you say that's not my job so you quit
sw2061A-ms98-a-0112 416.759750 418.194750 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0113 418.194750 419.227000 right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0114 419.227000 421.491750 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0115 421.491750 422.492375 right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0116 422.492375 425.629500 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0117 425.629500 426.738750 right
sw2061A-ms98-a-0118 426.738750 427.984375 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0119 427.984375 430.355750 no but i mean it's like it's like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0120 430.355750 439.704000 they they have like this different policy i don't know my dad works for them_1 but it's like IBM like never in their commercials they never put down any other company you know it's like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0121 439.704000 441.020750 they won't say
sw2061A-ms98-a-0122 441.020750 445.535375 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0123 445.535375 450.281125 yeah because see what happens is they have a good backup policy and anybody can fix it
sw2061A-ms98-a-0124 450.281125 452.499250 and so that's what you're gonna go for [noise]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0125 452.499250 454.053875 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0126 454.053875 458.493250 and and you know it's like for example like Leading Edge have you ever heard of Leading Edge
sw2061A-ms98-a-0127 458.493250 459.754875 what
sw2061A-ms98-a-0128 459.754875 461.502000 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0129 461.502000 464.603875 th[ey]- they made like uh small personal computers
sw2061A-ms98-a-0130 464.603875 465.650625 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0131 465.650625 468.275125 i don't know i- i don't know but what they do is
sw2061A-ms98-a-0132 468.275125 473.305625 what they did i don't know is buy all the parts that IBM would throw away
sw2061A-ms98-a-0133 473.305625 476.868500 and build an IBM PC with all the parts that IBM would throw away 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0134 476.868500 479.974125 yeah bec[ause]- so is it like for example you test a chip
sw2061A-ms98-a-0135 479.974125 483.275000 it can't last seven years but it can last five
sw2061A-ms98-a-0136 483.275000 487.432625 IBM says let's throw it away Leading Edge will say we'll buy it from you
sw2061A-ms98-a-0137 487.432625 490.618000 and so that's i mean they're still around i think [noise]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0138 490.618000 492.676750 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0139 492.676750 498.975125 so that's what that's what they do they buy all all the things that IBM throws away and they [vocalized-noise] that's why they're so compatible
sw2061A-ms98-a-0140 498.975125 503.594625 because i mean and by the time you have a computer for five years you're going to throw it away anyway 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0141 503.594625 505.257875 you know
sw2061A-ms98-a-0142 505.257875 507.289000 [vocalized-noise] well i mean there's like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0143 507.289000 515.256125 when when you realize [vocalized-noise] tea[chers]- one of my teachers got this computer and which you know it's like um voice uh synthesis and stuff [noise] 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0144 515.256125 518.748625 and he got that he said you know it's like um
sw2061A-ms98-a-0145 518.748625 527.621250 i was testing it and it was wonderful and then when you tried to erase and correct you know all the errors in your voice it takes up all your memory
sw2061A-ms98-a-0146 527.621250 530.413250 and i want more [laughter-you] [laughter-know] and it's like
sw2061A-ms98-a-0147 530.413250 534.483625 Jesus Christ you know it's like why do you want more because it's like one second
sw2061A-ms98-a-0148 534.483625 537.553250 of recording i mean you put into a Wave
sw2061A-ms98-a-0149 537.553250 539.983750 and you want to correct the errors in the Wave 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0150 539.983750 546.500500 takes so much i mean it's like of course it does i mean by the times it transforms into Wave by Markov model 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0151 546.500500 555.514000 and you put it in there and you want to correct those and then you know you're trying to make the the Wave smooth so you can approximately of course it's going to take a lot
sw2061A-ms98-a-0152 555.514000 561.324375 imagine imagine what it is for us to make Markov models you know it's like [laughter] Jesus Christ 
sw2061A-ms98-a-0153 561.324375 566.076000 [silence]
sw2061A-ms98-a-0154 566.076000 568.420000 yeah yeah
