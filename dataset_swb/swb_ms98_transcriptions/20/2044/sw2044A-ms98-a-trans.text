sw2044A-ms98-a-0026 121.619875 128.171750 well i know when we first moved here it was uh it was at the very beginning of the year nineteen eighty seven
sw2044A-ms98-a-0027 128.171750 134.275250 and uh we when we lef[t]- we moved from New Hampshire where it was snowing
sw2044A-ms98-a-0028 134.275250 148.107750 [noise] and we got here and we just couldn't believe how warm it was i mean it was in the fifties and we were taking off our winter coats and we were all dressed like Eskimos and uh and then soon after we had this big ice storm
sw2044A-ms98-a-0029 148.107750 156.886625 uh where everything was just covered with like an inch of ice and everybody uh and it was obvious that nobody knew how to drive in this weather
sw2044A-ms98-a-0030 156.886625 163.974875 and uh we were feeling very cocky because course we always in New Hampshire you always have that kind of weather but um
sw2044A-ms98-a-0031 163.974875 172.571250 uh and i just i just assumed that was the way it was you know you didn't get snow which was nice because_1 you didn't have to shovel it
sw2044A-ms98-a-0032 172.571250 180.569125 and but you al[ways]- you could expect to have this ice storm and i think there was in the three years we've been here there's been one other ice storm
sw2044A-ms98-a-0033 180.569125 188.538375 um y[ou]- the second year we had an ice storm and i was really surprised that uh that we didn't have anything like that this year

sw2044A-ms98-a-0035 192.427125 200.440750 it it uh w[ell]- it if you get any snow it's barely enough to hide the brown grass
sw2044A-ms98-a-0036 200.440750 206.936250 you know and uh certainly nothing that you have to do anything about um

sw2044A-ms98-a-0054 253.917750 266.162500 you know in up in New England you had more winter than you had a s[ummer]- summer and uh you could expect a long winter period uh for instance um [noise]
sw2044A-ms98-a-0055 266.162500 278.962000 we cou[ld]- you cou[ld]- uh in New England it would still be cold i mean ice cold snow kind of weather uh now in March it ju[st]- in March is is just when things
sw2044A-ms98-a-0056 278.962000 290.307250 start uh approaching the fifty degree mark a[nd]- course we've already had eighty degree weather here and d[ay]- day before yesterday it got up to eighty eight i think

sw2044A-ms98-a-0060 304.260125 312.794625 there could be yeah there could be a[nd]- and it came i mean i used to i used to work in Boston which was an hour and a half away
sw2044A-ms98-a-0061 312.794625 319.229750 and i would get up at five o'clock in the morning just to shovel out driveway
sw2044A-ms98-a-0062 319.229750 322.027875 and that's so i could leave by seven
sw2044A-ms98-a-0063 322.027875 329.325875 and uh so i would sometimes take me you know an hour or two to shovel the driveway in the morning and then i'd sitting in that car for an hour an a half
sw2044A-ms98-a-0064 329.325875 335.643500 and and well it was actually if the if the weather was bad enough to shovel snow it would take me three hours to get to work
sw2044A-ms98-a-0065 335.643500 339.870250 so and so now it takes me ten minutes [laughter]
sw2044A-ms98-a-0066 339.870250 341.489250 oh yeah

sw2044A-ms98-a-0071 356.662875 363.544125 they had the snow plows and the salt trucks and and uh they just you know they were equipped for it whereas here
sw2044A-ms98-a-0072 363.544125 368.391250 if you have a bad snow nobody's prepared to do anything about it you know the
sw2044A-ms98-a-0073 368.391250 374.706375 right right you know you y[ou]- you'd you get the first you know the f[irst]- first ice

sw2044A-ms98-a-0085 431.411375 441.078875 it's just great i mean we're really spoiled i mean there's a lot of things we miss about New England you know uh uh where there's no trees to speak of and the big
sw2044A-ms98-a-0086 441.078875 454.814250 you know thick trees we used to have in New England and we used to enjoy it we had a we had two acres of land attached to our house course we only had a thousand square foot house but we had [laughter-two] acres of land and um
sw2044A-ms98-a-0087 454.814250 464.466250 and so we that now we have this we have a house that's three times as big but we have less than a quarter acre lot [laughter-you] know and uh and uh
sw2044A-ms98-a-0088 464.466250 477.025125 that's right and uh so we kind of i[t's]- it's we've gone from one extreme to the other and that's that's been hard to adjust to but uh the weather we c[an't]- oh the weather's been wonderful

sw2044A-ms98-a-0095 500.380250 512.845625 the colors on the trees are just so vivid um oh it was just that that's something i miss i- i keep i'm [laughter] i get homesick thinking about it you know [laughter]

sw2044A-ms98-a-0098 525.744250 533.637500 and uh you'd have these hundred degree days where the humidity was just o[ne]- hundred percent and it was stifling
sw2044A-ms98-a-0099 533.637500 543.257125 uh here y[ou]- in in Dallas in the Dallas area the humidity you get some humid days but it's not nearly as bad you ge[t]- you get a lot of dry days too

sw2044A-ms98-a-0111 570.309375 575.299750 yeah everything's relative i guess yeah because_1 i grew up on the east coast
sw2044A-ms98-a-0112 575.299750 584.124500 and uh i'm originally from Virginia and uh and my memories of summer have always been that stifling humidity
sw2044A-ms98-a-0113 584.124500 586.708500 and compared to the humidity here
sw2044A-ms98-a-0114 586.708500 600.717875 you know in fact uh whenever i think about mo[ving]- you know whenever we talk maybe about moving back to the east coast the thing that comes back to me is that sensation of those stifling summers which which i don't experience here
