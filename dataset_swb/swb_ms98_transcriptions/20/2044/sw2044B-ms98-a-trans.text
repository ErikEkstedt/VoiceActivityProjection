sw2044B-ms98-a-0002 24.641750 35.944625 my husband's been in Dallas during an ice storm he said that he pulled up to a stop at a stop sign and completely stopped just slid to the side of the curb that they're that bad Lubbock
sw2044B-ms98-a-0003 35.944625 49.274375 we get ice storms but not not quite to that extent it's not the thin sheet you know all across the road ours if it ices over it's thick it's with snow it's something that you can drive on you can get a little traction with
sw2044B-ms98-a-0004 49.274375 53.470000 uh i think we've been fortunate that we've missed
sw2044B-ms98-a-0005 53.470000 60.351750 any of the real bad weather this year because we went to California instead [laughter] but right now
sw2044B-ms98-a-0006 60.351750 68.718500 um we're having unusually warm weather it's it's almost like they're try[ing]- it's trying to skip spring and go straight to summer it's either
sw2044B-ms98-a-0007 68.718500 75.879375 uh thirty degrees you know one day and ninety the next and and we're missing the fifties and sixties in there [laughter-somewhere]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0008 75.879375 78.801250 [silence]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0009 78.801250 85.621750 well i have been here permanently or full time since nineteen eighty and uh
sw2044B-ms98-a-0010 85.621750 99.909500 pretty much off and on since seventy four so really quite a while and i've watched the weather shift you know i can remember being here back in the seventies in college and the spring dust storms were
sw2044B-ms98-a-0011 99.909500 105.933750 uh they were massive i mean you could stand on one side of the street and not see buildings across the street
sw2044B-ms98-a-0012 105.933750 114.943625 that dust yeah [laughter] not fun to be in but i haven't seen any like that in probably five or ten years
sw2044B-ms98-a-0013 114.943625 120.020750 so it's it's changing and the summers are getting hot and the winters are cold but
sw2044B-ms98-a-0014 120.020750 123.075125 i guess i can live with it [laughter]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0015 123.075125 127.632500 [silence]

sw2044B-ms98-a-0026 187.590625 193.436875 well now does Dallas get snow or is it usually just the ice storm
sw2044B-ms98-a-0027 193.436875 199.746000 [silence]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0028 199.746000 201.643750 okay

sw2044B-ms98-a-0030 206.504250 217.940625 well that was one reason why i figured that i could stand Lubbock Texas that was about as much winter as i could get because i grew up west coast sunshine green leaves on trees
sw2044B-ms98-a-0031 217.940625 222.189125 came back here and could not realize why i'd been so depressed through the winter
sw2044B-ms98-a-0032 222.189125 230.573375 and realized that that was the first time in my life i had seen trees lose their leaves and uh and course when spring and everything came out again
sw2044B-ms98-a-0033 230.573375 241.927500 uh it was beautiful but that's about as much winter as i can take i mean it gets cold here and with wind chill it sometimes gets you know fifteen twenty degrees below because of the wind
sw2044B-ms98-a-0034 241.927500 249.648375 but it's not six feet of snow and it doesn't stay on the ground six months out of the year and i know the sun is coming [laughter]

sw2044B-ms98-a-0042 299.258125 305.368875 now was there actually snow on the ground all th[at]- that time from September through what March

sw2044B-ms98-a-0053 347.479125 350.444125 [silence]

sw2044B-ms98-a-0059 380.111500 392.391500 i was gonna say there've been several times when i know they had ice storms down in Dallas uh that we would be up here trying to call and it we'd figure out after about the first hour that there ain't nobody at work [laughter]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0060 392.391500 399.845000 [silence]

sw2044B-ms98-a-0075 476.258500 481.417000 [noise] that's good i did go up to New England one time during their fall season when the weather was just
sw2044B-ms98-a-0076 481.417000 493.833000 you know it was kind of a a brisk feeling outside but it wasn't freezing the leaves were turning and now that part of a winter up there i could truly love but uh
sw2044B-ms98-a-0077 493.833000 510.039125 [silence]
sw2044B-ms98-a-0078 510.039125 518.277625 uh-oh well what about your summers in Dallas now is that similar was it humid up in the New England states like it is down there
sw2044B-ms98-a-0079 518.277625 523.283375 [silence]

sw2044B-ms98-a-0083 550.376250 560.494625 is stifling humidity to me because Lubbock is so dry uh you know it may be a hundred and a hundred and five or whatever up here but there is no humidity and it's
sw2044B-ms98-a-0084 560.494625 571.832625 you know if there's a breeze blowing it's a nice comfortable day and you don't feel like you have to take ten showers a day because you you take a shower and walk outside and the humidity's so great you know you're sweating to death again
sw2044B-ms98-a-0085 571.832625 573.699250 yeah
