sw2073A-ms98-a-0007 48.351125 53.556375 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0008 53.556375 65.422750 that's true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the [polly/party] uh the party type [vocalized-noise] followers the guys that uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0009 65.422750 76.579000 you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if they're Republican they vo[te]- R[epublican]- vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent
sw2073A-ms98-a-0010 76.579000 80.151875 you know are the ones that don't uh don't really
sw2073A-ms98-a-0011 80.151875 83.979375 uh show up every year because_1 they can't seem to
sw2073A-ms98-a-0012 83.979375 89.705750 to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate
sw2073A-ms98-a-0013 89.705750 91.602625 yeah
sw2073A-ms98-a-0014 91.602625 102.174375 yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but [laughter] that didn't work
sw2073A-ms98-a-0015 102.174375 133.251250 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0016 133.251250 134.471625 um-hum
sw2073A-ms98-a-0017 134.471625 136.003125 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0018 136.003125 138.570000 yeah yeah that's uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0019 138.570000 150.860375 and and then people always get upset about it too because_1 you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote they'll get more votes [laughter] 
sw2073A-ms98-a-0020 150.860375 157.574375 i'm always amazed at that that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know
sw2073A-ms98-a-0021 157.574375 168.053875 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0022 168.053875 177.503875 yeah well that uh that's so[mething]- i i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because_1 we live in a pr[edominately]- pr[edominately]- predominately Catholic type area
sw2073A-ms98-a-0023 177.503875 186.616875 and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspir[ational]- inspired you know and uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0024 186.616875 196.866500 still on the other hand we're also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0025 196.866500 211.856125 you know it's it's women's rights and the a[nd]- and that sort of movement and so it's uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones
sw2073A-ms98-a-0026 211.856125 213.636875 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0027 213.636875 215.095250 but uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0028 215.095250 225.815250 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0029 225.815250 239.874125 yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isn't as much because_1 it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the
sw2073A-ms98-a-0030 239.874125 247.505000 the Midwest and uh it doesn't matter who they put in office they're going to fall subject to uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0031 247.505000 249.935250 the pressure that lobbyists can put
sw2073A-ms98-a-0032 249.935250 251.478375 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0033 251.478375 253.028875 well

sw2073A-ms98-a-0039 287.406875 294.234375 yeah well i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected
sw2073A-ms98-a-0040 294.234375 295.831875 uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0041 295.831875 297.623375 uh-huh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0042 297.623375 307.658750 unfortunately that'll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even mo[re]- uh turnout even more because_1 more Democrats will think that they don't have a shot so they won't even bother turning out
sw2073A-ms98-a-0043 307.658750 308.805625 [silence]
sw2073A-ms98-a-0044 308.805625 313.281000 they'll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election we'll see you in four years
sw2073A-ms98-a-0045 313.281000 323.757250 uh but yeah i hope some of the local well that's what they they keep saying that it seems like people with i[t]- with
sw2073A-ms98-a-0046 323.757250 331.893000 old-fashioned values are the ones that aren't turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh
sw2073A-ms98-a-0047 331.893000 346.175250 you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they don't come ou[t]- turn out to vote and they're the ones that uh you know really know what's going on have the experience and -[ha]ve seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever
sw2073A-ms98-a-0048 346.175250 349.552000 but i know my grandmother hasn't voted in years

sw2073A-ms98-a-0051 378.007125 389.949250 yeah wonder if they're going to take into account with this [commutiv/computerized] uh this computerized conversation that there's little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking [laughter]
