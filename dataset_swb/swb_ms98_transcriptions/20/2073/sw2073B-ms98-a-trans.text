sw2073B-ms98-a-0002 1.260125 3.480000 [silence]
sw2073B-ms98-a-0003 3.480000 15.619375 okay well um let's see i i think uh there's a lot of people that don't vote because they don't really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and
sw2073B-ms98-a-0004 15.619375 17.304000 you know there's such a
sw2073B-ms98-a-0005 17.304000 23.028000 small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and
sw2073B-ms98-a-0006 23.028000 27.865250 that you know their vo[tes]- votes not going to make that much difference
sw2073B-ms98-a-0007 27.865250 37.490375 and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person
sw2073B-ms98-a-0008 37.490375 46.563000 is going to have a lot of uh since there's so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them_1 so
sw2073B-ms98-a-0009 46.563000 53.206625 it'd be really difficult to have that one pers[on]- perfect person that believed exactly what you believed

sw2073B-ms98-a-0017 102.189375 116.517750 yeah there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um
sw2073B-ms98-a-0018 116.517750 126.949375 the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded
sw2073B-ms98-a-0019 126.949375 132.830875 as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things

sw2073B-ms98-a-0037 215.048750 225.457750 yeah that's true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place
sw2073B-ms98-a-0038 225.457750 241.302875 [silence]

sw2073B-ms98-a-0045 258.632750 269.774875 to get elected and then once they do get elected they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand
sw2073B-ms98-a-0046 269.774875 278.924625 you know maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know that's uh
sw2073B-ms98-a-0047 278.924625 285.590500 with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to
sw2073B-ms98-a-0048 285.590500 287.272625 even try to do
