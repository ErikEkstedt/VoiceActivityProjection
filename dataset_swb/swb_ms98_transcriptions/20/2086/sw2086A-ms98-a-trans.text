sw2086A-ms98-a-0018 97.420000 104.055125 that's um [noise] i uh i'm i'm not that great a cook but i was single until i was thirty so i did cook a little 
sw2086A-ms98-a-0019 104.055125 105.374250 you know uh 
sw2086A-ms98-a-0020 105.374250 112.965500 and i cook a little bit now [vocalized-noise] what i like to do mostly is stir fries and my wife normally says you know oh Tom why why don't you make a stir fry tonight 
sw2086A-ms98-a-0021 112.965500 119.749875 so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
sw2086A-ms98-a-0022 119.749875 122.542125 and we do a lot of um stir fry vegetables
sw2086A-ms98-a-0023 122.542125 125.647000 [silence]
sw2086A-ms98-a-0024 125.647000 136.740000 it's it's called a stir fry pan and it and it fits right on your uh si[t]- it fits right on your burner whether it's gas or electric so it's it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does
sw2086A-ms98-a-0025 136.740000 145.726125 and um normally what happ[en]- what we do is um just you know like two tablespoons of oil maybe sesame oil or some other type of oil than just regular
sw2086A-ms98-a-0026 145.726125 153.879750 oi[l]- vegetable oil but i will use peanut peanut oil or things and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and um green peppers and um
sw2086A-ms98-a-0027 153.879750 162.067125 maybe put in a little bit of um garlic and ginger uh beforehand that gives uh uh uh spicier flavor
sw2086A-ms98-a-0028 162.067125 166.272625 and then after the stir fry is over just mix in um
sw2086A-ms98-a-0029 166.272625 175.953250 a little bit of uh sometimes chicken broth and corn starch and soy sauce and that sort of makes a uh a glaze
sw2086A-ms98-a-0030 175.953250 183.098625 that sticks to the the vegetables i've used you turn them over a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu we don't put in meat
sw2086A-ms98-a-0031 183.098625 191.252375 cause i guess we're i'm not but uh she likes to watch all the how much red meat and things so we'll do a lot of times vegetarian
sw2086A-ms98-a-0032 191.252375 200.709500 but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and uh carrots and celery and green peppers and um oh gee mushrooms
sw2086A-ms98-a-0033 200.709500 202.994750 it's it's a pretty big and we put that over rice
