# VoiceActivityProjection

Voice Activity Projection is a Self-supervised objective for Turn-taking Events. This is an extended version which trains a stereo model (mono is still possible) that does not require any VAD information as input BUT do require separate channels for both speakers. Overbleed between the channels is fine as long as you have access to the VAD information (used as label during training). The stereo model greatly simplifies inference where the only input is a stereo waveform. The model is trained on a multitask loss defined by the original VAP-objective and a VAD-objective (predict the current voice activity over each frame for the two separate channels).

The model is a GPT-like transformer model, using [AliBI attention](https://ofir.io/train_short_test_long.pdf), which operates on pretrained speech representation (extract by submodule defined/trained/provided by [CPC facebookresearch](https://github.com/facebookresearch/CPC_audio)).

A state-dict tensor is included in the `examples/` folder:
* `example/VAP_3mmz3t0u_50Hz_ad20s_134-epoch9-val_2.56.pt`

## Use

The `run.py` script loads a pretrained model and extracts the turn-shift probabilities over a single waveform (stereo). If a mono-waveform is given it is assumed that it contains a single speaker and we automatically add a silent channel as speaker 2.

```bash
python run.py \
  --audio example/student_long_female_en-US-Wavenet-G.wav \ # waveform
  --sd example/VAP_3mmz3t0u_50Hz_ad20s_134-epoch9-val_2.56.pt \  # default state dict
  --filename my_output.json # saves the output to this file. Omitting this flag saves output to ./{AUDIO_FILENAME}.json
```

### Train (not yet publically available b/c of non open-source data)

WIP: working on making the training repo availble (however will not be useful if you don't have access to Switchboard/Fisher/Candor audio and annotation files). Please contact me if you have access and we can work something out :)

Training the model requires the private [vap_dataset](https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/vap_dataset) repo (for now) i.e. the relevant `pl.DataModule`. The repo creates dataset splits (.csv-files) which are provided as arguments to the training script. However, it is not strictly required and you could write your own `pl.DataModule` which provides a batch with chunks of audio and corresponding Voice Activity (VAD).

```python
batch['vad']  # (B, n_frames+horizon_frames, 2)
batch['waveform'] # (B, 2, n_samples) 
```

For training on 20s chunks (default) with a framerate of 50Hz and a 2s projection window -> `n_frames=(20+2)s * 50 = 1100 frames` and `n_samples=16_000Hz*20s = 320k samples`.


See `vap/train.py` for further details.

```bash
python vap/train.py --data_train_path TRAIN/PATH.csv --data_val_path VAL/PATH.csv
```

## Installation

* Create conda env: `conda create -n voice_activity_projection python=3`
  - source env: `conda source voice_activity_projection`
  - Working with `python 3.9` but I don't think it matters too much...
* PyTorch: `conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.6 -c pytorch`
    - Have not tested all versions but should work from `torch 1.12.1` as of time of writing...
* Install **`VoiceActivityProjection`** (this repo):
  * cd to root directory and run:
    * `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    * `pip install -e .`
* [OPTIONAL] Dependencies for training:
  * **DATASET**
    * Install [vap_dataset](https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/vap_dataset)
      * `git clone https://github.com/ErikEkstedt/vap_dataset.git`
      * cd to repo, and install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
      * Install repo: `pip install -e .`
